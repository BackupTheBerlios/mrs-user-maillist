<PRE>Hi,

Could I have your opinion on the following:

I've dropped the 'update' databank approach. Instead of this I now  
have an improved merge functionality that creates a complete index  
along with information on which documents have been superseded with  
updates.

This faster merging can also be used to create a uniprot file for  
sprot and trembl and thus the construct of 'sprot+trembl' as db name  
can be avoided as well.

And so I can move to a zero-config situation where the files  
available in the MRS_DATA_DIR define what you can see in the  
interface. Only problem remaining is the extra info the config file  
mrs.conf provided like e.g. the pretty name. I'm considering to store  
this information using an XML formatted string in the databank. This  
XML string will be generated by the parser and the interface can use  
it to find out what the databank is all about.

Is this an acceptable solution?

One other point remains, the merged databanks like uniprot and embl  
(containing embl_release and embl_updates) can contain the full data  
from the original files but it is also possible to link to the  
original file. In case of linking, the databank will become  
unavailable when one of the parts is deleted (by an update e.g.) and  
has to be recreated.

I can work around this by using hard links, the idea is to create a  
hard link for each part that will be merged and the merged databank  
will point to the new link instead of the original. Then, when you  
update one of the parts that part will create a new part file but the  
previous version will still be around since you linked it and the  
link is not deleted. If you don't understand how links work, this can  
be quite confusing.

Is there anyone willing to comment on this? Other suggestions?
