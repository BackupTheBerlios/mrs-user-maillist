<PRE>Hi,

I've been working on updating the backend of MRS for version 3 and I  
believe I've done most of the work.

Apart from being faster, the new version has these new features:

- meta data fields. You can store extra data along with the document.  
I'm using this for the title only but other fields could be added  
like e.g. species. The size of the databank increases only slightly  
since e.g. the title data is redundant and the compression algorithms  
take care of detecting this.

- update databank support. A databank can contain a so called omit  
vector which is a bit vector that stores which documents in the  
databank have been superseded by new ones. This works by detecting  
duplicate ID's being entered, only the last document is searchable.  
Together with an increased merging speed this replaces the previous  
update databank mechanism using the pipe symbol.

- a new and much better SOAP server. It is created using gSoap and is  
a very fast SOAP interface together with a WSDL file describing what  
can be done.

- the parser and format scripts have been merged into one new script.  
I also changed the script support a bit to make it easier to add new  
databanks.

The frontend is not yet finished. Although the perl scripts from mrs  
2.0 still work (maybe there are a few modifications required, I'll  
have to check that) I decided to drop the Perl/CGI approach in favor  
of a Java/Struts based application. That allows me to create a much  
nicer user experience IMHO.

You can see the new interface at work here: <A HREF="http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs-3/">http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs-3/</A>

The code for this new version of mrs is at <A HREF="https://svn.berlios.de/">https://svn.berlios.de/</A> 
svnroot/repos/mrs/trunk

I did some changes in the installer script, but I never tested this  
so don't expect it to work.

Hopefully there are some of you willing to test this new version?

Robert: I hope to have some time soon to revise your documentation  
for this new version.
