</I>&gt;<i> After spending several hours installing MRS, I
</I>&gt;<i> finally managed to compile it the following way:
</I>
I'm sorry it took you so long.

&gt;<i> - install a fresh Fedora core4 on an old PC.
</I>
An old PC is not the right PC to use with MRS. Hosting MRS is not a  
problem, but indexing really requires a lot of CPU horsepower.

&gt;<i> - run install.pl and install the HUGE!!! list of all missing modules
</I>
You do get a virgin perl with core 4 then...

&gt;<i> - try to make install in the &quot;plugin&quot; directory,
</I>&gt;<i> that was the most difficult and annoying part.
</I>&gt;<i>     my fresh Fedora was missing the correct SWIG,
</I>&gt;<i> BOOST and GCC, but unfortunately these
</I>&gt;<i>     were not seen as outdated by YUM. Thus I had to update them  
</I>&gt;<i> manually...
</I>
SWIG is not needed for a simple recompile. There may be a warning  
about a missing swig but that warning should contain a statement that  
this is not fatal.

&gt;<i> - after updating these tools, the compilation went OK.
</I>&gt;<i> - modify httpd.conf and restart apache. This was OK.
</I>&gt;<i> - try to &quot;make&quot; a database available...
</I>&gt;<i>     I tried both UniProt and Prosite, but
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately it didn't work, and I am stuck here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> more /usr/local/data/status/prosite.make_log
</I>&gt;<i> make[3]: Entering directory `/usr/local/share/mrs/update_scripts'
</I>&gt;<i> make[3]: Nothing to be done for `data'.
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/mrs.pl create -d prosite
</I>&gt;<i> Can't locate object method &quot;version&quot; via package
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;prosite::parser&quot; at /usr/local/bin/mrs.pl line
</I>&gt;<i> 290.
</I>&gt;<i> Parsing done, creating index... make[3]: ***
</I>&gt;<i> [/usr/local/data/mrs/prosite.cmp] Illegal
</I>&gt;<i> instruction
</I>
Apparently MRS is crashing on your computer. Since you were talking  
about an old computer, what CPU does this computer have? Illegal  
instruction often means it is compiled for another CPU than the one  
you're using. It might very well be that you e.g. have a PIII and try  
to run a P4 compiled application on it. That won't work.

And then, sometime ago someone at GNU headquarters decided it was a  
good idea to rename gzcat to zcat. You can try to edit the GZCAT  
variable in your make_xxx.conf file to point to your copy of zcat.
