<PRE>Hi Andrea,

&gt;<i> I'm sorry to come up with all those little problems, but I guess  
</I>&gt;<i> this is
</I>&gt;<i> just what happens once software tested in one place is let loose on  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> world with all its different setups...
</I>
No, no! I really appreciate all the feedback I can get. That's the  
only way to improve my software.

&gt;<i> This time, I tried to test blast.
</I>
There needs to be a separate manual for this, it is not trivial to  
set up.

&gt;<i> Since the job was never terminated
</I>&gt;<i> (according to the web interface) I had a look at the temp-directory
</I>&gt;<i> where it was supposed to run.
</I>&gt;<i> The first thing I noticed is that there wasn't any output at all. So I
</I>&gt;<i> guess it wasn't really started either. Or shouldn't the output be  
</I>&gt;<i> found
</I>&gt;<i> in the temp directory? If it should, do you have any hint how to trace
</I>&gt;<i> why the script wasn't started?
</I>
In the mrs-submit.cgi script you can find some lines that try to  
start a job in a queueing mechanism. Some of these are commented out,  
the one currently active uses the 'batch' command of your Linux  
system. But for batch to work, you have to enable 'at'. There was a  
posting on this list from Robert recently describing what he needed  
to do in order to get at to work.

To have a look at the current at queue there is a command called  
'atq' and usually at runs every 5 minutes. That means your job might  
wait until the next at run and that can take up to 5 minutes. You  
have to config at to run in smaller intervals.

&gt;<i> To find out more, I also tried to run the query_xxxxx.csh script  
</I>&gt;<i> and its
</I>&gt;<i> individual commands to find out what happens. And what I got was a  
</I>&gt;<i> core:
</I>
The core you get is because mrs_blast tried to open your sprot.cmp  
file but wasn't allowed to. Perhaps the permissions on sprot.cmp are  
not correct? You might also make sure that mrs knows where to find  
the mrs files. For this MRS uses the environmental variables  
MRS_DATA_DIR which should contain the path to the MRS files.
