<PRE>Hi Maarten

see below for my comments; I've given them rates from 1 to 5, 5 being 
the highest priority
from my point of view..
&gt;<i> - call back for parser scripts
</I>&gt;<i> 	The idea is to be able to do queries on other databanks from inside a 
</I>&gt;<i> formatter script. This way you can e.g. enable or disable links to other 
</I>&gt;<i> entries that may or may not exist.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>prio: 4
&gt;<i> - linking
</I>&gt;<i> 	The SRS way of linking results from one databank to records in another.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>prio: 4
What I would like to have here, is not (like SRS) have just one way of 
linking 2 databanks, but several
ways of linking them... That also means expanding the query language to 
be able to express what  link route to
use... Also, one thing that would not be needed from my point of view, 
is the &quot;shortest route&quot; type of linking,
where you can link database A to Z while there are no direct links 
available and the system could get
their using a shortest route approach. Reason is, often you don't end up 
with the things you want; so you
just end up writing out the route in the query language from hop to hop...


&gt;<i> - more RDBMS like storage of records
</I>&gt;<i> 	This may be necessary to do the linking right. It allows for more SQL 
</I>&gt;<i> like queries and perhaps even nested queries. MRS already has so-called 
</I>&gt;<i> meta data fields for storing extra information along with a document but 
</I>&gt;<i> the implementation may need to be improved.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Not sure if with RDBMS you mean a Read/Write system... that for me 
wouldn't be high prio (prio: 1).

prio: 5 Wrt the meta data fields, yes I would like to see that 
improved... so like the SRS way,
you could do getz -f 'id des aut' '[embl-des:prion]' e.g. and only those 
fields would be returned, similar to in
sql doing &quot;select id, des, aut from embl where des like '%prion%';
Where the main important thing I think is, being able to basically - out 
of the MRS box - be able to just select
any field that the &quot;parser&quot; knows of... so e.g. also sequence field, 
without having to store it (from the admin/dev
point of view) in the meta data again... I guess just keeping pointers 
to those pieces of info in the file (cmp)
won't work since the data is compressed?

&gt;<i> - case sensitive indices
</I>&gt;<i> 	Needed for the RDBMS feature and some databanks (wikipedia e.g.)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>in RDBMSystems it's configurable ; I believe in mysql the default is 
case-insensitive... So also for me, not
high prio. prio:1

&gt;<i> - DNA blast and all the translated versions.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>prio:2
Wrt amount of work, I think a &quot;wrapper&quot; approach would be a lot faster, also
for future developers, instead of re-implementing it. (I'm assuming 
currently
it's a kind of re-implementation...).

&gt;<i> - allow the storage of images inside a databank
</I>&gt;<i> 	Should already be possible, but I never tried it... There's no way to 
</I>&gt;<i> access such images from a web page yet.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>prio 1


&gt;<i> - more databanks
</I>&gt;<i> 	
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if all of this is doable. And I'd like to hear where you 
</I>&gt;<i> think priorities are. If you have additions to this wish-list, please 
</I>&gt;<i> post them here.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>prio: 1 (but I'm biased ;) ).

thanks for asking Maarten,
regards,
Koen
