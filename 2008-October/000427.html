<PRE>Hi,

I noticed performance of the website was not exactly what I had hoped 
and so I did some benchmarking on the hardware I was using. Our server 
has three sets of disks, one is an RAID0 configured set of six 2.5&quot; SAS 
disks, an Apple X-RAID with 7 RAID5 configured disks (2.8TB) and 
connected through fibre channel and we have an iSCSI configured computer 
with 4 1TB disks connected with a dedicated 10 GB cross-link cable.

Unfortunately the SAS disks are not big enough to store the MRS files, I 
only have 400 GB available there so I use this as the scratch area 
during indexing.

The sustained throughput to the iSCSI device was higher than the XRAID 
and so I decided to store the MRS file on the iSCSI device. But I should 
have been wiser. The problem is, the mrs server application caches a lot 
of the index to avoid excessive disk access. However, when you do a 
search on all databanks you will end up with quite a list of documents 
that match. And for each document the server has to retrieve the 
document's title. This means the disk has to seek each document.

I ran bonnie on all three disks and noticed that the number of seeks per 
second differed dramatically. The SAS disks were capable of 960 seeks/s, 
the XRAID did 300 and the iSCSI device only 60...

That explains why simple searches could take up to a minute without 
taking any CPU.

So I moved the MRS files over to the XRAID and query times are now 
reduced by a factor 5.

duh...

And so everything works again as I intended.

What this means for the average MRS site is, try to configure your 
server with fibre channel if you can spare the money, choose directly 
attached disks (preferably with a real RAID controller) otherwise.
