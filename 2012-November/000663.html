<PRE>Dear all,

Today I've reached a milestone in the development of MRS 6 (aka M6). I 
believe I implemented all the end-user functionality of the old MRS 5 
and then some. For the administrator I still have some work to do.

To see for yourself: <A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/m6/">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/m6/</A>

As you can see, it still looks the same. (Although the search term 
suggestion drop down menu in the search form is gone. I can reimplement 
it, but I'm not convinced it is very useful since it was a bit slow. I 
could make it an option though.)

M6 is a total rewrite of MRS, sometimes it's better to start all over. 
The result is:

For end users:

- Better search results. The new tokenizer now works with utf-8 natively 
and splits more aggressively resulting in better recall. The same 
tokenizer is now used in document parsing and query parsing.
- Searching is much faster and less memory is used in the server.
- Linking has been improved. You can now search records that are linked 
to records in another databank by entering a query like: 
[sprot/PRPH2_CANFA] and this will return records in the searched 
databank that are linked to the record PRPH2_CANFA in the databank sprot 
(swissprot). You can have multiple records between the brackets and you 
can combine this with other query statements.
- A lot more links are now available in the default configuration.
- Rendering of a pretty layout (SwissProt e.g.) is now done with 
JavaScript at the client side. That means that if there's an error in 
the layout code, the raw record is displayed instead of an error page.
- Blast for protein databanks is still available and now uses a disk 
based caching system. This means results remain available until the 
databank is updated, even between restarts of the server. The blast 
works on FastA files directly and you can specify where they are located.
- Most web service calls remain the same, but some have been dropped 
after examining the log files (e.g. cooccurrence and clusterdocuments 
were never used).

For administrators

- Configuration is different. A parser is now much more bare-bones, it 
only provides parsing functionality. All the other configuration is done 
in the main configuration file.
- FTP mirror code is now implemented in C++. The source is specified in 
the standard configuration file. If you need rsync, you'll have to set 
that up yourself.
- Data is no longer stored in a single file, MRS now uses directories 
containing all the data files instead.
- There will be administration pages protected by a password, but I'd 
like to hear from you what should be in there.
- Installation now consists of only three executables. In the final 
release I will reduce that to one.

I'm now planning to do some serious testing and implement code to make 
administration easier. I could e.g. create a webapp to change the 
configuration file. And I will spend a lot of time trying to write 
decent documentation. I believe that was one of the main weaknesses of 
the previous MRS releases...

It would be nice if some of you could also try this new MRS. I could use 
some feedback. MRS 6 source code can be checked out from

<A HREF="https://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/m6/tags/6.0b1/">https://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/m6/tags/6.0b1/</A>

There's a document called 00-readme.txt that describes how to build M6 
from source code for both Linux and Windows. I can also send you 
binaries directly, just send me an e-mail.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
