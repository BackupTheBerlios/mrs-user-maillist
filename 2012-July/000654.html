<PRE>Hi Maarten,

It's good to see that you are developing this. I have some general 
comments that hopefully will help you shape the direction of MRS 
development.

1)In terms of performance: I see that you are indicating the need for 
new space improvements. For me the greatest issue is lookup/search 
performance. Sysadmins and managers of production MRS installations are 
aware of the floating effect of flatfile databases (like EMBL) and they 
spec their storage accordingly should they wish to keep up with full 
size releases. However in my view mrs-ws did not perform incredibly fast 
with a simultaneous user load of more than 30-40 sessions. 5 was a big 
improvement and things are getting better, so this is what I am hinting 
as an MRS goal: If it is simple enough to use (which it is) and searches 
are fast, it is a clear winner.

2)Having said 1), I would also like to point out that it might be worth 
considering offering the functionality to download and crunch EMBL 
subsets, as opposed to the full release. What I tend to find amongst my 
users, is that they are often interested in smaller subsets of the EMBL 
dataset: say EST human databases and/or HTG mouse sequences. Giving the 
user or MRS manager the ability to follow the taxonomy division of the 
EMBL file sets and having the ability to choose what to download and 
format via a simple interface would:
i)reduce download, indexing, storage and search runtime requirements for 
people that do not need everything.
ii)make MRS easier to use with sample real world data sets in a 
classroom environment, where students can have laptops and/or smaller 
servers and see what MRS can do.

3)I see that you are trying to simplify the system by reducing the 
number of binaries and dependencies. That's good. May I also suggest 
that we try and produce Debian and RedHat packages, to 
simplify/standardize the installation on all major OS platforms and 
distros.

4)Help: I can help you with:
i)Testing.
ii)Production of RPM packages for RedHat distros
iii)Maybe some much needed documentation.
iv)Maybe some parser construction. I know a couple of people that would 
like to port their databases to MRS, so that's a nice exercise to get 
into the process of writing parsers.
In the process of doing this, may I suggest that you consider opening 
access to an svn or other version control system, so that what we are 
able to contribute goes back to one single repository.

That's all from me.

Best regards,
GM

Best regards,

</I>&gt;<i> Since I had to work on another project (a new HSSP creator) for the

</I>&gt;<i> that HSSP seems to be working, I can pick up MRS again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to know if there are others willing to help. Since the code 
</I>&gt;<i> is still in development, it is still possible to change direction. I 
</I>&gt;<i> would also appreciate help in writing parsers and formatting code for 
</I>&gt;<i> the new MRS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My original goal with MRS 6 (aka M6) was a single executable capable 
</I>&gt;<i> of doing everything. I still would like to do that, but it is rather 
</I>&gt;<i> ambitious. Perhaps I will have to create an early release that 
</I>&gt;<i> delivers the improvements for the end user and keep the improvements 
</I>&gt;<i> for the maintainers for a later release? The improvement in 
</I>&gt;<i> responsiveness may be worth this split.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I did so far:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Complete rewrite of the index and search algorithms. New file format 
</I>&gt;<i> (actually, data is now stored in folders) which is much more space 
</I>&gt;<i> efficient (EMBL is now 353GB instead of 456GB)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - There are now three executables, 'm6' is the driver for several 
</I>&gt;<i> actions like 'build'. 'm6-server' is the new mrs-ws. And there is 
</I>&gt;<i> a m6-passwd that generates password hashes for the new admin pages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - m6 build indexes databanks based on a simple XML script. No 
</I>&gt;<i> more Perl plugins. (Eventually this script should be editable with a 
</I>&gt;<i> graphical editor. This is one of those features that can be pushed back?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The m6-server has a subset of the current mrs-ws functionality, but 
</I>&gt;<i> a lot is still missing. Formatting of databank records is now done in 
</I>&gt;<i> the browser using JavaScript and that seems to work very nice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I have a new protein blast implementation (fixing some performance 
</I>&gt;<i> reducing bugs I introduced years after writing the original code). 
</I>&gt;<i> This blast works on FastA formatted files directly. (It is used 
</I>&gt;<i> in HSSP too).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What needs to be implemented:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - a blast and clustal interface in the server
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - all the SOAP calls of mrs-ws (should be simple: copy and adapt 
</I>&gt;<i> the mrs-ws code).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - status pages
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - an automatic update system. (I might keep this for a later release 
</I>&gt;<i> and instead use makefiles for now.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A test framework and a thorough testing of the entire system to make 
</I>&gt;<i> sure I did not forget anything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're willing to help me with this new MRS, please let me know. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm especially looking for feedback on the design decissions I made 
</I>&gt;<i> and help in writing new parser and formatter code.
