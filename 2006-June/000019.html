Yes. This helps

</I>
I like the MrsWeb path. It keeps good humour around MRS installers ;-). 
So you suggest this as default and allow for change if installer insists 
on it.

&gt;<i> - I can create a mrs.conf file for the user
</I>
Which mrs.conf ? That one from the cgi-bin with the list of installed 
databanks ? No leave this for another round. The managers should know 
what to declare and each paragraph is rather self-explanatory.

&gt;<i> - I can hack the htttpd.conf file to add mrs
</I>
This I would not do. We have apache 2.2.2 on our boxes (not from vanilla 
distibutions) and the script and scriptalias lines you mention are not 
sufficient. You require in addition the declaration of a  
&lt;Directory&gt;...&lt;/Directory&gt; structure to get it working. Also recent 
Apache installation recommend NOT to touch httpd.conf, but use includes 
from separate config files.

&gt;<i> - I can find or copy an installation of jmol for use in the structure  
</I>&gt;<i> pages
</I>
This is a structure visualiser, isn't it. Nice to have but should be 
optional.

&gt;<i> - I can try to find out whether the user has clustalw installed and  
</I>&gt;<i> enable/disable the page accordingly?
</I>
Nice to have. Same as preceding.

&gt;<i> - I can try to find out whether a queueing system is available and  
</I>&gt;<i> use that for blast...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Certainly useful, especially when blastn and blastx, tblatsn and friends 
will be there. But this can be left out for &quot;advanced&quot; installations.

&gt;<i> As you can see this is on an increasing scale of complexity. Maybe  
</I>&gt;<i> good documentation is of more help here than a script that tries to  
</I>&gt;<i> do everything but that will probably fail due to unforeseen problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>A very interesting option, as long as you don't have a home brew blastn 
(and  friends...), would be to allow for calls, from a MRS query result 
list, of an independent NCBI Blast. I guess this has been the case on 
some cmbi installation. I am wrong ?
I agree that the users should not be encouraged to run blastn as their 
first option (most badly trained tend to do so, and end up with heaps of 
useless info...)
Have a good evening !
