</I>&gt;<i> can be prevented (just comment out the &quot;rm&quot; line in the  
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding script !). Having these sections on a peer-to-peer  
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem might be a great exercice in sharing. While Uni.  
</I>&gt;<i> Karlruhe is building a _secured_ P2P filesystem, public solutions  
</I>&gt;<i> like BitTorrent is a tempting approach suggested by David. What do  
</I>&gt;<i> you think, David and George ? And Lubos, are you on the list ?
</I>
I've never used BitTorrent so I don't know how this would work out.

But I can give some remarks.

First of all I will have to implement a better balancing algorithm  
since the parts in EMBL differ extremely in size. Genbank is nicely  
balanced and EMBL should be the same to make it useful to divide the  
indexing work among other computers.

BitTorrent might be nice to have. But the question is, how many sites  
will have MRS files available? And will that be enough to make the  
use of BitTorrent worthwhile? Besides, it would be nicer if after the  
release of a large databank like EMBL all sites that volunteer to  
share in indexing agree on what part they will index to avoid doing  
duplicate work. That also means there needs to be one server that  
divides the tasks to the indexing sites and collects the location and  
ID of the parts that are finished so that others know where to pick  
them up.

A fair bit of programming and testing will be required to do  
something like that.

And then the question is, will it pay back? I mean, downloading the  
raw files takes many hours. Downloading the MRS parts from other  
sites will take even longer. Indexing the files yourself might be  
faster, especially if you don't have a fast link.
