<PRE>	Dear Maarten,

If you allow me to make a remark about saving sequences in fastA format. 
We agreed (see thread &quot;port features MRS2 -&gt; MRS 3&quot; of March) that the 
possibility to save sequences in fastA format is a very useful feature.
I have noticed that you have added in the parser for EMBL some code to 
&quot;Show fasta sequence&quot;/&quot;Hide fasta sequence&quot;. I am not so happy with this. 
It is tedious for the developer (need to duplicate the code in all 
parsers) and for the end users (need to copy-and-paste a lot). In MRS2 it 
was possible to click on a &quot;Save&quot; button (even if for nucleic acids the 
thing was confusing, since the sequences did not appear directly in the 
Web page, but you could get them into a file anyway). Is it not possible 
to have something in the interface that makes it possible to get protein 
as well as nucleic acid sequences in fastA format in either the Web 
window or into a file on the user's PC and this as well for a single 
entry as for a search set ? I know for sure that there are end users who 
can very well use this.

	Regards,
	Guy Bottu,
	BEN
