<PRE>	Dear colleagues,

Thure Etzold, the developer of SRS, once said &quot;You cannot imagine anything 
that crazy or there is at least one database manager who really does it&quot;. 
While trying to put in our MRS server databanks with the protein and 
nucleic acid sequences extracted from the PDB, I bumped on the following 
problem : some have identifiers only different by case. E.g. there is a 
1fnt_A and a 1fnt_a. Now, most bioinformatic software is not case 
sensitive. I understand that MRS stores indices so that they can be 
displayed in their original case, but can only be searched
case-insensitively ; it does automatically modify redundant indices, e.g. 
1fnt_a is stored as 1fnt_a_12835. This is however not ideal. Should MRS 
be adapted so that it can handle case sensitive indices ? This will 
however not solve everything, since other software like EMBOSS or GCG is 
also case insensitive. My idea is to let the MRS parser store 1fnt_aLC
(LC means lowercase) as identifier. A user can then search for the 
sequence he needs in MRS and in EMBOSS (if the EMBOSS installation uses 
MRS as databank access mechanism) ask for the sequence pdbprot:1fnt_alc.
This would of course also work with 1fnt_a_12835 but it avoids the use of 
a meaningless and irreproducible number. Anybody a comment ?

	Regards,
