Message-ID: <4237F985FA3A4CBF970C63EFD68D9C9C@boar>

Dear MRS developers,

It seems that MRS 6 incorrectly defines the number of findings.
The following query:
"DE:complete AND OS:Burkholderia AND DE:chromosome"
finds 87 records, but with message on the first page
"Records 1-15 of 2,817,818"
and on the last (6th) page:
"Records 76-87 of 2,817,818".
There are also hyperlinks to 7th, 8th etc. pages, but they lead to pages "No hits found".

And a question: is it possible to download all 87 findings at once, not by selecting them 
one by one?

Sergei Spirin,
Belozersky Institute, Moscow

Hi,

Greetings!

We have been using MRS (version: 4, OS: RHEL5.1) since long and 
encountered a problem we are unable to debug, thereby need your 
consultation and guidance.


We have two ways of posting a SOAP request (raw xml) - one using soapUI 
and other using perl SOAP client. Using perl SOAP client we are able to 
post the request and successfully receive the response. Now the problem 
chips in when we are making the soap call using soapUI. Below is the error 
log.

While posting the SOAP request using soapUI the mrsws service is getting 
killed for the reasons unknown to us. We then got back to our the UNIX 
server team to find out what might be causing this problem. But they were 
only able to report back with the fact that the mrs service has been 
segfaulting fairly regularly, and further the logs weren't of much help.

Then we again posted the soap request using soapUI and simultaneously 
analysed the logs, where we found the whenever a soap request is posted 
(using soapUI) the mrsws service gets restarted and finally gets killed. 
This phenomenon but doesn't happen when we post the soap request using 
perl SOAP client.


We also tried to access mrs6 @ http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/m6/ and are getting 
expected response. Below is the corresponding query for the same.
 
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/
" xmlns:sear="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/m6/mrsws/search">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <sear1:Count xmlns:sear1="http://ratchet.am.lilly.com:18081">
         <sear1:db>uniprot</sear1:db>
         <sear1:booleanquery>os:human</sear1:booleanquery>
      </sear1:Count>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>


Your help would be greatly appreciated. Please let us know in case you 
require additional information.

Dear Sergei,

The number given for the result count of a boolean search is always a
guess, unless the exact count is known by the time the page is rendered.
This is a optimisation similar to what other search engines do, try to
browse through the pages of a Google result to see it happening there too.

And to download more than one document, click the checkbox before the
first document and then hold down the shift key and click the checkbox
before the last item in the list. An overlay should appear at the bottom
of the page containing a button labelled 'Download'. You can use that
button to download the selected documents.

Hope this helps.

Dear MRS developers,

It seems that MRS 6 incorrectly defines the number of findings.
The following query:
"DE:complete AND OS:Burkholderia AND DE:chromosome"
finds 87 records, but with message on the first page
"Records 1-15 of 2,817,818"
and on the last (6th) page:
"Records 76-87 of 2,817,818".
There are also hyperlinks to 7th, 8th etc. pages, but they lead to pages "No 
hits found".

And a question: is it possible to download all 87 findings at once, not by 
selecting them
one by one?

Dear Shailesh,

MRS 4, that?s code from 2009. Since then I wrote MRS 5 and then decided to dump everything are rewrite MRS from scratch resulting in MRS 6. That last version is the one you should use, it is much faster and much more stable.

I?m afraid this is not the answer you were waiting for.

Best regards,

-maarten
