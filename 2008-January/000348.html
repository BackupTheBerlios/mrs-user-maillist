You mean you don't have enough diskspace for the intermediate files
during an update?

I hope to receive a new computer for our own MRS server next week and a
feature like this is planned since this new computer will have very fast
scratch disks.

But that means that unfortunately now there is no such provision yet.
You could try to hack the makefiles and move the parts manually to
another location after creation and put a symbolic link in their place
at the main disk. Then you can also add the -l option to the merge
command (in make.post) which will not copy the data into the merged file
but only use a pointer to the actual data in the parts. You will then
also have to comment out the line that removes the parts after a
successful merge (also in make.post).
