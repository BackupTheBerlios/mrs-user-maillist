<PRE>I've moved the subversion repository of MRS from Berlios back to the 
CMBI. I also made public the source code for the web application.

The new URL's for the two projects are:

	<A HREF="https://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs/">https://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs/</A>

and

	<A HREF="https://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsweb/">https://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsweb/</A>

I'm in the middle of a heavy rewrite of MRS so don't expect the code to 
be stable. My current focus is on simplifying the set-up and daily 
update process and documenting the way things work. Have a look at the 
new update scripts directory to get an idea what I'm talking about.

MRS will consist of a couple of command-line applications instead of one 
monolithic Perl script. There is a new mrs-build application for 
indexing and a mrs-test application for various tests on databanks. The 
mrs-query application will be upgraded to be actually useful and 
mrs-blast should work (eventually) as before. All applications should 
print out usage information when run without any parameters.

The web services will be combined into one application: mrs-ws. This 
application can run several search instances each with its own set of 
databanks. This can be used to shield off private databanks from the 
outside world based on ip address and port number using a firewall. The 
web application will be changed to allow for users to login. Known users 
will have an enhanced environment with perhaps access to restricted 
databanks and there will be a couple of administrator pages to monitor 
the update process.

The configuration will be concentrated in the mrs-config.xml file. The 
goal is to move all configurable information there, for now you still 
need to put some logic in the parser scripts and the new databank.info 
file in the update_scripts directory which replaces all the previous 
per-databank make files.

It's all a work in progress, but I would really appreciate it if someone 
could have a look and provide some feedback. Installation is 
straightforward, extract the code from the trunk and run:

./configure.pl
make
make install

This will produce errors at this moment since the mrs-ws application is 
not finished and I've not even started writing a new plugin. But if you 
ignore the errors you get at least a working mrs-build, mrs-test and 
mrs-query application and a set of new parser and update scripts.

BTW, the parser scripts have changed slightly since version 3.1.
