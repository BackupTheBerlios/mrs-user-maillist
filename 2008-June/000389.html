&gt;<i> Is the splitting change applied to both version 3.0 and 3.1?
</I>
Version 3.1 (and 3.0) use the 'merge' step to create smaller parts of 
large databanks and then merges those together into a larger one. This 
was done because the indexing step gets slower over time when the 
lexicon grows. Another reason to create separate parts was to make more 
efficient use of multiple CPU's present in the server.

Now that the indexing step is capable of using multiple cores this last 
reason is no longer valid. But EMBL remains a problem. On the other hand 
I get question regularly from people who are only interested in 
subsections of EMBL. They might like it to be able to search only the 
particular section they're interested in.

This new indexing will be part of MRS 4.0 which will bring so-called 'in 
document location' of words. One use of this new data is more 
efficiently searching for phrases. But I will also implement a 'near' 
function where you can specify that two words should be located 'near' 
each other in the text. You can imagine this new functionality requires 
quite a bit more of storage and that's another reason I'm considering 
splitting EMBL.

&gt;<i> And BTW, I'd like to know which version the website of
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/</A> is?
</I>
I believe it is very close to the one which is in the 3.1 branch in the 
SVN repository at Berlios. There will be an update to the website as 
well for 4.0. I'm working on the implementation of permanent sessions 
with login for end users. There will also be a set of admin pages to 
display indexing status and to do things like restarting indexing jobs.
