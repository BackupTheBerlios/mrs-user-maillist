<PRE>Dear MRS user,

I've created a new release, version 5 is now final. As you may notice, 
the version number is actually 5.0.2b and of course this means I've 
debugged it already quite a bit.

The most important new feature is the addition of the new web 
application (which was actually implemented in libzeep). This mean you 
no longer need a separate Java web application to access MRS with a web 
browser.

Now this unfortunately also means that backward compatibility with older 
browsers had to be axed. I decided that apart from Firefox (3.6), Opera 
and Chrome I now support only Internet Explorer 9.0 since supporting 8.0 
and older was a bit too much work. But in the beautiful tradition of 
'Open Source' software, you're free to fix this. The only thing that 
needs to be fixed is a couple of JavaScript files, I think... If you 
feel like helping here, go to the docroot directory for MRS (default is 
/var/lib/mrs/docroot) and hack the HTML and JavaScript there.

Another major change is the support for more the Unicode character set. 
I've received reports that it is now possible to index Chinese text and 
even search it.

This also means you have to add a charset specification to the parser 
files. By default MRS assumes ASCII text (most databanks are ascii 
anyway) but you can specify utf8 as character set in the constructor of 
the parser. See wiki.pm for an example.

I've renamed the tools a bit, to run an update you now can use the 
mrs-update tool (which is actually simply an executable makefile). I 
also made configuration a bit easier by trying to reduce the number of 
configuration files. And the default location for configuration files 
has changed a little (they are now together in a separate directory 
inside /etc).

To make installation easier if you're using Ubuntu, I create a PPA. This 
means that if you have Ubuntu Maverick (10.10) on an amd64 machine, you 
can do the following to install MRS from scratch:

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:hekkel/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mrs-all

See the <A HREF="https://launchpad.net/~hekkel/+archive/ppa">https://launchpad.net/~hekkel/+archive/ppa</A> page for more info on 
this PPA.

After installing MRS this way you can run e.g.:

mrs-update enzyme

(That's not going to work on a fresh install, you'll have to run
'sudo -u mrs-dba mrs-update enzyme' since the directories are by default 
owned by user mrs-dba).

Starting the web-service is done by running

sudo /etc/init.d/mrs-ws start

After which you can access the MRS web interface at port 18080.

If you want to build from source code, you can also fetch the source from

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cmbi.ru.nl/pub/software/mrs/">ftp://ftp.cmbi.ru.nl/pub/software/mrs/</A>

Don't forget you also need libzeep, which can be found here as well.

There are man pages for all the installed tools, in case you need help.

Changes that didn't make it in this release are the NCBI blast 
integration. That will have to wait for a next release, I hope it won't 
take too long.
