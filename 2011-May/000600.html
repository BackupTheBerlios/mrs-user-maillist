<PRE>Hi Martin,

&gt;<i> Thanks for your hard work on the new MRS release. I would like to use 
</I>&gt;<i> it, mainly I would like to install it and test its interface to find 
</I>&gt;<i> out if I need to make some changes in the MRS::Client module. But it 
</I>&gt;<i> has been long time since I installed it last time and I do not 
</I>&gt;<i> remember where to get MRS from :-) Before I start to use the PPA 
</I>&gt;<i> package (or before I compile it from the source), I wonder if you can 
</I>&gt;<i> clarify few issues:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The PPA site has the MRS 5.0.3-1, the ftp site has MRS 5.0.2b. What 
</I>&gt;<i> is the latest released version?
</I>
Ah, fixed that. You can always get the source of the PPA version by 
using e.g. 'apt-get source mrs-all'.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * If I install it from the PPA, does it overwrite the current, 
</I>&gt;<i> installed previous, version of MRS? I understand that if I run both I 
</I>&gt;<i> would need to change the port numbers (that are, I believe, the same 
</I>&gt;<i> in both versions) - but otherwise can the two versions co-exist? How 
</I>&gt;<i> it is with previously indexed datasets; are they compatible or should 
</I>&gt;<i> I re-index them for the new version?
</I>
The PPA won't overwrite the older version. That's because the PPA 
installs in /usr while the old version installed in /usr/local by 
default. Config file for the new version is in /etc/mrs and for the old 
one in /usr/local/etc. So theoretically you can share one data directory 
with two installations of MRS. And if you specify separate port numbers 
in the two config files you can even run the servers along each other.

You can also specify the config file to use from the command line for 
most of the tools.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Is there any documentation about the new release? When I looked into 
</I>&gt;<i> the package mrs-5.0.2b.tgz, the INSTALL file still refers to the 
</I>&gt;<i> release 4.2. Is there any notes/docs about transferring from mrs 4 to 
</I>&gt;<i> mrs 5?
</I>
Ah, the INSTALL file... I forgot I had one...

I did update the HTML documentation:

<A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs-5/help?page=50">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs-5/help?page=50</A>

and

<A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs-5/help?page=51">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs-5/help?page=51</A>


The changes between 4 and 5 are basically summed up in a previous post 
to this list. But to summarize it:

- New installation method, and as a result new default installation 
directories. Also, the installation scripts assume there is a user 
called 'mrs-dba' who owns the created MRS files.
- The make script is now an executable i.e. you have to run 'mrs-update 
enzyme' instead of 'make -f /xxx/makefile enzyme'.
- New application server in mrs-ws, no longer need to run a Java web 
application.

And then there were quite a few minor bug fixes.

Hope this is sufficient to help you to start evaluating MRS 5? If not, 
please let me know. I don't think you need to change your MRS::Client 
code. If I changed the SOAP interface, I only exteded it. And if I broke 
it, I didn't do that intentionally. Honest.
