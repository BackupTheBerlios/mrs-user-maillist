<PRE>Marteen,

Thanks for your hard work on the new MRS release. I would like to use it,
mainly I would like to install it and test its interface to find out if I
need to make some changes in the MRS::Client module. But it has been long
time since I installed it last time and I do not remember where to get MRS
from :-) Before I start to use the PPA package (or before I compile it from
the source), I wonder if you can clarify few issues:

* The PPA site has the MRS 5.0.3-1, the ftp site has MRS 5.0.2b. What is the
latest released version?

* If I install it from the PPA, does it overwrite the current, installed
previous, version of MRS? I understand that if I run both I would need to
change the port numbers (that are, I believe, the same in both versions) -
but otherwise can the two versions co-exist? How it is with previously
indexed datasets; are they compatible or should I re-index them for the new
version?

* Is there any documentation about the new release? When I looked into the
package mrs-5.0.2b.tgz, the INSTALL file still refers to the release 4.2. Is
there any notes/docs about transferring from mrs 4 to mrs 5?

Thanks,
Martin
