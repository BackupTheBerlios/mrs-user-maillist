No, there isn't.

Technically, what MRS does is create a data structure in memory that 
assigns a number to each unique string found during parsing (called a 
lexicon). It is this technique that makes MRS fast, but also makes it 
resource hungry. Besides, suppose mrs was to run out of memory, one 
would have to dump this structure to disk. Obviously, that's not very 
useful since you need  as much memory to read this back in again.

With MRS 4 it will be possible to index EMBL within 24 hours but at the 
cost of 16 GB of memory. (We recently upgraded our server to 32 GB which 
cost us 1500 euro.)

Suppose I was to bring down memory consumption, which is technically 
possible of course, this will mean there will be a hit somewhere else. 
If I rewrite the lexicon to use disk backing store, performance will 
collapse. If I reintroduce merging, lots of time will be lost with this 
merging step.

As a 'solution' you can build smaller databanks. E.g. you can split EMBL 
into the separate sections 'EST', 'ANN', etc. and index those. Then, 
using the mrs-config file you can link those together to create one new 
virtual databank. However, query performance will then be not as good 
and there are issues with ranking.
