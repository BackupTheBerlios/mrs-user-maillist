OK, fair enough... I'll fix this.

The reason I didn't implemented this in the first place was that I  
thought it would be cool to be able to copy/paste a piece of text  
from a record and then be able to find this record back again. That  
means skipping over punctuation and such without producing errors.

But that doesn't work anyway when there's a colon or minus somewhere  
in the copied text. :-/

(Did you know you can search for -human to exclude all records  
containing the word human e.g.?)

So ok, I'll do this. The question though is, what should be regarded  
as boolean operators. The obvious candidates are AND, OR and NOT. In  
fact, AND is implicit, only OR is needed. NOT can be replaced by  
'-' (as it is now) or even '!'. And then AND and OR could have  
synonyms in the form of '&amp;' and '|'.

hmmm

When we choose to accept AND, OR and NOT at least these will have to  
be case sensitive. Otherwise the grammar gets too ambiguous.

But is it an option to allow only '-' and '|' as operators (along  
with parenthesis of course). Your query would then be entered like:

&quot;os:carica os:papaya (de:protease | de:proteinase)&quot;

Is that acceptable?
