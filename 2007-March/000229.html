<PRE>Dear Guy,

&gt;<i> I have some theoretical questions about how MRS 3 functions :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - the sorting of query results according to importance : is it  
</I>&gt;<i> simply the
</I>&gt;<i> number of times a query word is found in the entry or is it more
</I>&gt;<i> sophisticated ?
</I>
The scoring is based on the so-called Vector Matching algorithm. The  
idea is that a document is a vector in an N dimensional space where N  
is the number of unique words found in the entire databank. A query  
is considered to be a document and documents can be compared by  
looking at their vector. If you calculate the cosine of the angle  
between two vectors you get a number between 0 and 1 where 1 means  
identical and 0 means no relation whatsoever.

All terms are adjusted using the TF/IDF correction mechanism. This  
stands for term frequency and inverse document frequency. The IDF is  
calculated as
	
	log(1.0 + N / M)	

		where N is the total number of documents in the databank and M is
		the number of documents containing this term.

During indexing the TF is calculated by counting terms in a document  
and then scale these TF's for each term by setting the highest  
scoring term to 1. At the end of indexing the total weight for all  
documents is calculated and stored in the MRS file (this is the  
square root of the sum of the squares of all TF's in the document:  
Sqrt(Sum(tf*tf)) ).

Scoring is then done by accumulating for each term in the query the  
product of each TF in the query and each document it is found in  
corrected by the IDF factor. After accumulating these values the  
accumulated values are divided by the weight of each document  
calculated earlier. We then have for each document a score and take  
the top of these as result. An attempt is made to score only those  
documents that score for each query term.

To optimise things a bit I've implemented an early termination  
algorithm that stops accumulating TF's once the TF for a term in a  
document drops below a value that is no longer significant for the  
final score.

This is in short the Vector algorithm, there are two closely related  
scoring mechanisms called Dice and Jaccard which are also supported.  
There's no way in the current interface to select another algorithm  
though, I'm working on that.

BTW. To store TF's for each term and each document I had to add a new  
index type, a so-called weighted index. By default MRS creates  
regular indices, but if you add weights it will create a weighted  
index. The last step in indexing creates the __ALL_TEXT__ index which  
is a weighted index containing all terms found in any other index. It  
is this index which is used for calculating the scoring.

&gt;<i> - the alternative spelling suggestions : what algorithm does it use ?
</I>
The makefiles can be used to create .dict files for each MRS  
databank. Such a dict file contains a Trie structure for the words in  
a index. The defaults for creating such a file are to use the  
__ALL_TEXT__ index for collecting words and to use only words at  
least 4 characters long that occur at least in 4 different documents.

Then, when a word is checked against this trie, characters are  
compared and for each match a reward is added to a score. For each  
mismatch different classed of modifications are scored: insertions,  
deletions, transpositions and substitutions each with a different  
penalty. The trie structure makes it very easy to quickly try out all  
combinations and the final list is sorted by score.

&gt;<i> - the parsing of text into separate words. How are word strings  
</I>&gt;<i> delimited ?
</I>
In a regular expression: [0-9a-z_]+((-|\.)[0-9a-z_]+)*

That means in english, a words starts with one or more characters  
from the 'word character class' W containing digits, alphabetical  
characters and underscores. Then either a single hyphen or a dot  
followed by one or more W characters can follow in one or more sets.

So, a word cannot contain two consecutive hyphens and/or dots and  
trailing hyphens and dots are not allowed.

As an extra, if a word contains only one hyphen and no dots the two  
groups at each side of the hyphen are stored as separate words as well.

I hope this answers your questions. Feel free to ask for more  
explanation if needed.
