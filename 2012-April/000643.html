<PRE>Dear all,

Unfortunately running the mailing-list software at the CMBI is not going 
to work, so I've moved the list back to Berlios. My apologies for the 
inconvenience.

Based on the feedback I got recently I decided to completely rewrite 
MRS. The code was growing too complex, there were too many dependencies, 
building MRS proved to be too difficult on some systems. And then the 
performance degraded considerably recently.

MRS-6 aka M6 will be distributed as a single, statically linked, binary 
executable for either Linux or Windows. Configuration will be done using 
a web application. Parsers will be written in a completely new way based 
only on regular expressions. The dependency on Perl has gone, makefile 
are gone too, update will be managed by the web application, formatting 
of entries will be done using JavaScript at the client side.

The SOAP and REST API will remain as it is. This means that any script 
or application accessing MRS over a network connection will continue to 
work, I will make sure the MRS::Client script will remain working. But 
since there may be changes in the parsers, indices may have changed and 
since the query parser has changed too, results for more complex queries 
may be different.

I'm not sure if I will distribute the source code for the new MRS. One 
of the reasons is that it will compile only when you have the Intel 
compiler, I will definitively no longer support using GCC. That compiler 
has cost me too much time already.

If you want to see the results a very early development version of M6 is 
running at &lt;<A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl:18090/">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl:18090/</A>&gt; This version is far from 
feature complete but shows in which direction development is going.

I understand this news may be a bit unexpected and not very welcome for 
some. But I believe something had to change given the problems that came up.

best regards,

-maarten
