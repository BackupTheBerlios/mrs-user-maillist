Thanks. I will take a look.

How many MRS versions should we support .... 5 and 4? Is 3 now obsolete?

Yes please.

We have SOAP access methods in the EMBOSS release but they will not be 
built by default - they need an external library - so we would prefer 
REST but can of course implement both and give them different access 
method names.

Thanks for the help,

Peter
