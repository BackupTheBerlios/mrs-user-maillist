REST calls in mrs follow the same syntax as SOAP calls. Perhaps you 
should try to have a look at the WSDL for mrs, It may look intimidating 
but it's not hard to figure out what's in there.

If you look at the Find command e.g., you'll see in the WSDL that it 
takes seven parameters, one of which is an array, the others are single 
parameters. You the construct a URL that starts with:

<A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsws/search/rest/">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsws/search/rest/</A>

Then you add the function you want to call, e.g. GetEntry:

<A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsws/search/rest/GetEntry/">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsws/search/rest/GetEntry/</A>

And then the parameters, since they are name, order is not important:

<A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsws/search/rest/GetEntry/db/sprot/id/104k_thepa">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsws/search/rest/GetEntry/db/sprot/id/104k_thepa</A>

And that's it.

For enumerations (e.g. Format type) you can find the accepted values in 
the WSDL.

Unfortunately, this rest call interface does not support nested objects, 
so using FindBoolean is not an option I'm afraid since you'll have to 
use SOAP calls for that. That's too bad, because FindBoolean allows you 
to construct very efficient queries very easily.

Suppose you would like to do SOAP, you could create a SOAP enveloped 
message from your scripts and POST it to the MRS server. That way you 
don't need a full SOAP library to do simple SOAP calls.

Let me know if you would like to see some examples of this technique.

&gt;<i> EMBOSS 6.4 will support queries in addition to simple retrieval by ID if
</I>&gt;<i> we can define search fields.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any tips on how to do that (e.g. for queries that may return large
</I>&gt;<i> numbers of entries)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, can the REST queries combine search fields (another new EMBOSS
</I>&gt;<i> capability)? Or should we try SOAP for that?
