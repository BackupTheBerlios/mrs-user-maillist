<PRE>Dear all,

Today, I managed to create a new web service application for MRS that 
doesn't need gSoap any more. I created a new library to easily create 
SOAP (and at the same time REST) servers from a C++ class. It uses 
several recent additions to the Boost libraries and thus the new MRS 
needs at least boost 1.36 to build.

Since I will release the new SOAP library as a separate stand along 
library soon, I'm holding back the release of MRS 4.1 a bit. But for 
those of you who want to have access to the 4.1 code now, you can 
contact me and I will send it to you.

The replacement of gSoap comes with a price though, I updated the WSDL 
for MRS a bit since there were some subtle problems with the old one and 
I took the opportunity to clean up the API a bit. One problem e.g. was 
that there were parameters with hyphens in their name, and some 
languages/tools were not capable of correctly mapping those into native 
variables.

The new MRS is available at <A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs-web-test/">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs-web-test/</A>

The new WSDL's and the web service app are available at

<A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl:18081/wsdl">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl:18081/wsdl</A>

Which reminds me of another thing I had to change. It seems that a new 
version of libuuid comes with a uuidd daemon process that uses port 8081 
by default. And I used that port for mrsws' search webservice. duh...
