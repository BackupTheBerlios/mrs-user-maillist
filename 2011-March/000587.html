<PRE>Dear all,

I'm working on a new version of MRS. This new version will be much 
easier to install and manage, eventually. I plan to make available a 
debian package to make installation on Debian and Ubuntu as easy as 
possible.

I also decided to dump the Java web application. Instead, I extended my 
zeep library to make it possible to do web application development in 
C++. For now this means that the new MRS only works with very recent 
browsers. I moved part of the logic from the Java web application into 
the Javascripts that control the web pages.

The code is not completely stable yet. And so I'm not going to offer the 
debian packages yet. But if you want to see what it looks like, you can 
visit <A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/</A> and you can also check out the source code 
from <A HREF="https://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs/trunk">https://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs/trunk</A>

Before I release the final MRS 5 version, I want to finally implement 
linking. I know this is highly overdue, but I think I finally found out 
the way to do a proper interface for this feature.

Some pitfalls you should be aware of in case you want to try MRS are:

- The new mrs-ws application is installed in /usr/local/sbin instead of 
/usr/local/bin. Watch out you're launching the right one if you're 
upgrading.
- The parsers have changed. You can not have both the old and new 
parsers fully functional in one directory.
- updating is now done with 'mrs-update' which actually is an executable 
makefile, but makes it as easy as typing just:

	mrs-update enzyme

- The old Java application can still be used, but since the parsers 
changed, internal MRS hyper links are broken.

Best regards,

-maarten

</PRE>
