<PRE>Hello, everyone! 
 
 I have started to deploy MRS recently, as an aid for local research. Really appreciate this work after a little dip in, for the elaborate thoughts, clear structure, extensibility in it and its being quite friendly for newbies like me.
 
 I have run into a little trouble though.
 
 (1) Generally I use 'make databank' in update_scripts to build mrs files from raw. Sometimes I just use mrs-build as I have downloaded the raw files before. Everything goes well for small databanks. But when I build big databanks like refseq and trembl, I get errors. 
 
 The error information for refseq build is &quot;Out of memory! Callback called exit&quot;, while it's a std::bad_alloc error for tremble build.
 
 I assume the memory of my workstation is not enough, which is 2G. I want to know whether there is a solid memory requirement for MRS, 8G? 32G? Or more? And is there any chance to introduce more exchange between physical memory and disk so as to lower that requirement? 
     
 (2) I have tried the two mrs-web-4.*.wars in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cmbi.ru.nl/pub/software/mrs/.">ftp://ftp.cmbi.ru.nl/pub/software/mrs/.</A>
 
 For mrs-web-4.0, after deployment, the display of blast.do was a little weird. Different div with CSS class 'box' tend to overlap. I tried 4.1 and the blast.do page displayed well. 
 
 At first I thought this happened because of CSS difference between 4.0 and 4.1, checked with '$diff', but found the CSS files hadn't changed. Then I '$diff' the blast.do files of 4.0 and 4.1 which I saved from the browser. Rather surprised, I found the '&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;' seemed to be the cause.
 4.0: &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;
 4.1: &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd</A>&quot;&gt;
 I located the source of this line in mrs-web-4.*/pages/layout.jsp, and changed the 4.0 file according to the 4.1 file. Then the display of 4.0 blast.do turned ok.
 
 Anyone knows how the doctype affected the page layout? Any introduced CSS tag unsupported for HTML 4.0  Transitional?  





Any Help would be greatly appreciated! ^_^ 

 
 
 
Brian
