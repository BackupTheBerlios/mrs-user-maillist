<PRE>Dear Harald,

Yes, I'm aware there is a problem with the current .war. Problem is the
way the configuration of a war can be done in other servlet containers,
(read: cannot be done...). And so I messed up. Tomcat uses a file called
context.xml for environmental variables you can set from the outside.
Glassfish is supposed to use the same file, but I'm not so sure it
really does.

You might want to extract the .war file and edit the web.xml file. It
contains a section with 'environment variables' somewhere at the bottom.
Either remove this or fill in the correct values for your site.

I'll try to upload a new .war file, but that might be difficult since
I'm not allowed to access my computer at work at the moment (due to a
case of flu in the family). So you might want to work around this
problem in the way described above.

If you're comfortable with Java development, you might also want to
check out the web application from <A HREF="http://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsweb/trunk">http://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsweb/trunk</A>
edit the web.xml file and then build a new war using maven.

&gt;<i> Maarten,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am running into some problems with getting the MRS web application 
</I>&gt;<i> deployed properly on Tomcat 6. Despite changing the environment 
</I>&gt;<i> variables to point to localhost rather than your server ( mrs.cmbi.ru.nl 
</I>&gt;<i> ), Tomcat keeps trying to reach <A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl:18084/.">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl:18084/.</A> It sticks 
</I>&gt;<i> at the SYN_SENT stage, and I have to wait for that to timeout before I 
</I>&gt;<i> can reach anything. MRS is unavailable even after the timeout, so there 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be something strange here.
</I>&gt;<i> A bit of searching has shown that this URL is found in several *.class 
</I>&gt;<i> files, which I can not modify. I realize that not all of these 
</I>&gt;<i> references will matter, but apparently some of them do stick, even after 
</I>&gt;<i> I have changed all the configuration files I have been able to find. So 
</I>&gt;<i> at present, I am stuck in trying to get it working.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that you have switched to using Glassfish rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> Tomcat for the application server. Is this a switch that you would 
</I>&gt;<i> recommend we make as well to get it working? If so, do you have a quick 
</I>&gt;<i> how-to for setting this up?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If not, do you have any suggestion on what I need to do to get it to run 
</I>&gt;<i> on Tomcat 6?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
