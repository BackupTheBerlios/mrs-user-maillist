<PRE>Maarten,

I am running into some problems with getting the MRS web application 
deployed properly on Tomcat 6. Despite changing the environment 
variables to point to localhost rather than your server ( mrs.cmbi.ru.nl 
), Tomcat keeps trying to reach <A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl:18084/.">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl:18084/.</A> It sticks 
at the SYN_SENT stage, and I have to wait for that to timeout before I 
can reach anything. MRS is unavailable even after the timeout, so there 
seems to be something strange here.
A bit of searching has shown that this URL is found in several *.class 
files, which I can not modify. I realize that not all of these 
references will matter, but apparently some of them do stick, even after 
I have changed all the configuration files I have been able to find. So 
at present, I am stuck in trying to get it working.

I understand that you have switched to using Glassfish rather than 
Tomcat for the application server. Is this a switch that you would 
recommend we make as well to get it working? If so, do you have a quick 
how-to for setting this up?

If not, do you have any suggestion on what I need to do to get it to run 
on Tomcat 6?

Thanks,
-Harald Dahle
