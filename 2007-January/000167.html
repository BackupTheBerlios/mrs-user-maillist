<PRE>Hello,

I took a fresh Ubuntu installation on a Pentium box in order to test the 
installation of MRS as recently updated by Maarten.

Here are my findings:
I had to add to the initially simple vanilla Ubuntu 6.10 installation 
the following packages that the &quot;perl install.pl&quot; procedure complained 
about:
- gsoap
- boost, the libboost-regex and libboost_fielsystem packages including 
the _dev derivatives (the _dev rerivatives are generally the include 
files not provided by the basic packages)
- g++ (the g++4.1 was already there but loading the basic g++ provided 
the required logical links c++ and g++ to it)
- libg++.dev
- libaatr1.dev
- libxml2 and libxml2.dev

With all this, the perl install was satisfied.

Now the make command revealde a few more requirements:
- libbz2.dev (to ptovide the bzlib.h file)
- libperl.dev
- libexpat1 and libexpat1.dev

And with this the make succeeded, which means it produced all that is 
required in the plugin and ws subdirectories.

A last issue was raised when starting the ws/mrsws module... It 
complained about /usr/local/data/mrs not being a valid directory. This 
is indeed correct on my machine, as I declared my intention to store the 
MRS files in my /data directory. Thus the installation script did not 
take care of my choice. Putting a link to it from /usr/local and 
creating the mrs subdirectory solved this minor issue.

Now downloading and building MRS datasets could start in the ususal way 
:<i> go to the update_scripts directory and type e.g. make omim or make go. 
</I>Soon the corresponding raw directories get filled and corresponding 
mrs-formatted files become available.

I could also install the MRS3 system in a very similar way on a 
dual-opteron (64bit) computer where databank downloading and indexing 
just started. Soon GO, OMIM and UNIPROT became available. As I ask for 
the embl_release on this one, I will have to wait a few hours to be able 
to claim about success...;-) This system had already previously received 
several additional packages &quot;by hand&quot; and I cannot claim precisely about 
which are really required for a proper MRS installation.

I still have to install the access to the webserver on my machines.

Congratulation to Maarten for providing a nice  installation system 
which is essentially bugfree.

Robert Herzog
