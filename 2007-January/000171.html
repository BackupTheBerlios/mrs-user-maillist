<PRE>Hi Robert,

I was just about to reply to the list and say that I had an OK 
experience compiling with on an up-to-date FC5 x86 (32-bit)  including 
the gsoap issue (2.7.6e, manually compiled on my site directory and 
ldconfig-ed into the system, prior to MRS configure and make steps). I 
have NOT tested the compiled binaries, as unfortunately I needed to 
allocate the spare disk space somewhere else and did not have space to 
download and index flatfiles :-( , so the fact that I compiled might not 
say a lot.

Next month I shall continue the test on the FC5 install and also attempt 
to migrate on an FC6 x86_64 VM , when I get a bunch of new disks fitted 
to the system and will post an update if necessary.

Also a general question for the list. I am going to present MRS on a 
bioinformatics users forum here in Oslo. Being aware of its feature set, 
the question I would like to ask is if somebody has performed extensive 
query benchmarks between MRS and SRS. My impression is that it is 
faster, however our SRS installation is not the latest and the greatest 
and it does not run on the same hardware as the MRS pilot tests, so I 
don't compare apples to apples. Any pointers to formal or informal 
comparative benchmarks would be very helpful to me.

Thanks very much.
