<PRE>Hi Robert,

&gt;<i> I took a fresh Ubuntu installation on a Pentium box in order to  
</I>&gt;<i> test the
</I>&gt;<i> installation of MRS as recently updated by Maarten.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are my findings:
</I>&gt;<i> I had to add to the initially simple vanilla Ubuntu 6.10 installation
</I>&gt;<i> the following packages that the &quot;perl install.pl&quot; procedure complained
</I>&gt;<i> about:
</I>&gt;<i> - gsoap
</I>&gt;<i> - boost, the libboost-regex and libboost_fielsystem packages including
</I>&gt;<i> the _dev derivatives (the _dev rerivatives are generally the include
</I>&gt;<i> files not provided by the basic packages)
</I>&gt;<i> - g++ (the g++4.1 was already there but loading the basic g++ provided
</I>&gt;<i> the required logical links c++ and g++ to it)
</I>&gt;<i> - libg++.dev
</I>&gt;<i> - libaatr1.dev
</I>&gt;<i> - libxml2 and libxml2.dev
</I>
I had this list somewhere, I compiled it today. Should have added it  
to my previous mail, sorry.

&gt;<i> With all this, the perl install was satisfied.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now the make command revealde a few more requirements:
</I>&gt;<i> - libbz2.dev (to ptovide the bzlib.h file)
</I>&gt;<i> - libperl.dev
</I>&gt;<i> - libexpat1 and libexpat1.dev
</I>
Those were on that list too... But it is good you mention them here,  
I will add those to the install script. BTW, perhaps I should rename  
that script to 'configure'.

&gt;<i> And with this the make succeeded, which means it produced all that is
</I>&gt;<i> required in the plugin and ws subdirectories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A last issue was raised when starting the ws/mrsws module... It
</I>&gt;<i> complained about /usr/local/data/mrs not being a valid directory. This
</I>&gt;<i> is indeed correct on my machine, as I declared my intention to  
</I>&gt;<i> store the
</I>&gt;<i> MRS files in my /data directory. Thus the installation script did not
</I>&gt;<i> take care of my choice. Putting a link to it from /usr/local and
</I>&gt;<i> creating the mrs subdirectory solved this minor issue.
</I>
Yes, I need to fix that. You can override the default value using the  
mrsws config file of which I've included a sample in the ws directory  
(mrs-config.xml) or by passing in the correct value with a switch on  
the commandline. Run 'mrsws -h' for more options.

The mrsws config file should be installed in some common location  
(e.g. /usr/local/etc) during installation.

&gt;<i> Now downloading and building MRS datasets could start in the ususal  
</I>&gt;<i> way
</I>&gt;<i> : go to the update_scripts directory and type e.g. make omim or  
</I>&gt;<i> make go.
</I>&gt;<i> Soon the corresponding raw directories get filled and corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> mrs-formatted files become available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could also install the MRS3 system in a very similar way on a
</I>&gt;<i> dual-opteron (64bit) computer where databank downloading and indexing
</I>&gt;<i> just started. Soon GO, OMIM and UNIPROT became available. As I ask for
</I>&gt;<i> the embl_release on this one, I will have to wait a few hours to be  
</I>&gt;<i> able
</I>&gt;<i> to claim about success...;-) This system had already previously  
</I>&gt;<i> received
</I>&gt;<i> several additional packages &quot;by hand&quot; and I cannot claim precisely  
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> which are really required for a proper MRS installation.
</I>
Good.

Indexing large databanks like embl_release should be noticable faster  
compared to the previous release. The reason for this is that I  
changed the lexicon structure from a binary tree to a patricia tree.

Be careful though, files created with version 3 are not backward  
compatible with version 2.

&gt;<i> I still have to install the access to the webserver on my machines.
</I>
I will write a Sys V init script for mrsws so you can put it in /etc/ 
init.d/ on a Linux system. I think I know how to do that on Red Hat,  
I have no idea if this will work on other Linux flavours though. Help  
in this area would be appreciated.

&gt;<i> Congratulation to Maarten for providing a nice  installation system
</I>&gt;<i> which is essentially bugfree.
</I>
Thank you.

I'll fix the last few quirks tomorrow and will then continue writing/ 
revising documentation.

I'm not sure what to do with the web interface at the moment. The  
perl based scripts are no longer part of the 3.0 distribution but I  
haven't released the Java based web app either. The web app still  
needs some work, like adding integration with blast and clustal like  
the current web site has.

For the blast part I want to write a SOAP wrapper around mrs_blast.  
That's pretty straightforward. But for the clustal/multiple alignment  
I had hope to find code in Java to do this. But I haven't found any  
yet. Is there anyone on this list who knows of a freely available  
Java implementation of a multiple alignment algorithm?

mvg,

Maarten L. Hekkelman
