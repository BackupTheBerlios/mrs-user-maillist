Yes, perhaps.

First of all, I do not consider the interface as 'finished'. What I  
think is finished is the indexing part, the scripts and the web  
services API. The Java based frontend should actually be considered  
as a proof of concept.

That being said, the functionality for doing wildcard searches is  
still there, in the backend and for boolean searches. The reason it  
is not yet available in the interface is that I have to write some  
more code to allow for wildcards in ranked query searches. I'll try  
to explain this.

When using wildcards you're actually creating a query that is being  
expanded before being executed. In your example we're using the ID  
index and search for all keys containing *_papaya. All these keys are  
added to a regular boolean query and this new boolean query is then  
executed.

To support wildcards in ranked queries we have to do something  
similar. There's one problem though, all terms in a ranked query have  
a rank themselves and this rank is used in calculating the score.  
This means that I cannot simply replace a query term containing  
wildcards with a set of other query terms since I will have to  
calculate a new rank for these new terms to make sure the results  
remain in the expected scoring order.

This is well researched territory, and I know what needs to be done.  
It is similar to query expansion using thesauri e.g.. The only  
problem is, I didn't have time to work on this yet.

So for now you can continue using the Perl based interface with all  
its quirks and problems. Or you can directly send your wildcard  
queries to the web services API.
