<PRE>Hi colleagues,

I have the pleasure to announce that I completed today the installation 
of MRS3 on a dual-opteron (this is 64bit) computer running Ubuntu 6.10. 
Practically all packages were installed from the distribution, which 
should make this machine pretty easy to maintain. I must say I am very 
impressed by the user friendlyness of Ubuntu. These people knwo what is 
ergonomy and system management ! Thanks to them.

The last hurdle towards an MRS web interface to the indexed databanks 
was the tomcat security issue installed by default on Ubuntu. The 
solution was discovered by Richard who was trying to start GRIA on the 
same machine, with the same kind of error messages that bubbled up, 
telling about &quot;denied access&quot;. The solution resides in the tomcat 
startup script, it says &quot;security=yes&quot;. This has to be put to &quot;no&quot;, 
exactly as it is done by default on SuSE and Gentoo boxes, and when you 
install tomcat &quot;by hand&quot;.

I have indexed embl_release and updates, as well as uniprot and a few 
smaller banks. Indexing went pretty well, once all files were 
downloaded. I had to restart the downloading several time in order to 
get the full set.
EMBL release indexing took about 2 days. The updates, based on the daily 
update files (no longer the cumulative updates) completes daily in about 
2-3 hours, and we are half way towards next release.

Kudos to Maarten for the nice software!

More about this later on. The computer is not yet visible on the Internet.

Robert
