<PRE>Dear Heikki,

Our main MRS server is running Ubuntu 8.04. On this computer I downloaded and installed boost version 1.36 and I specified this accordingly when running the configure.pl command. Building boost takes some time, but it is needed if you want to use an OS that does not come with version 1.36 or later.

The warning messages about missing files when running make are really only warnings, I don't know of any way to suppress them and they go away after you've build MRS one time. If the make dies then there must be some real error message hidden somewhere in the output.

The (subversion) source code repository can be found at: <A HREF="https://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs/">https://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs/</A>

I stopped creating regular releases since I had the impression there were not that many users of MRS still around. I do continue developing MRS, albeit at a slow pace, since we use it ourselves quite heavily. Whenever I release something, I try to highlight the main points in this mailing list.

If you still have problems creating a binary version of MRS, let me know and I can send you my binaries.

Best regards,

-maarten hekkelman

Maarten et al,I need to get started with MRS and I am wondering what would be the best wayto start?The rest of the mail just chronicles what I have tried without success.

I tried 4.1 download on Ubuntu 8.04, but the libboost is not up to date.Adding newer versions does seem to work, so many programmes in ubuntu aredependant on the currently used versions. Compiling a new version somewhere

else in the disk seems like a lot of work. Is the development now done on aKarmic alpha?A recent post talks about a repository. How could I access it?I did try the 4.0 tarball where the configure script does not have any

problems finding right versions of libraries, but make dies immediately onloads of missing files in the Obj.NoDebug directory.Which of these versions is considered stable? The berlios download area onlyhas 3.0.1.

Also, I can not find descriptions of feature differences in variousreleases.
