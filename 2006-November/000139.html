<PRE>Hi Guy,

First of all, thanks for your feedback.

&gt;&gt;<i> To replace the concatenated databanks, you can merge the parts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Merging sprot and trembl on my server takes about 15 minutes. And it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is possible to create a merged databank that doesn't copy the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document data, in that case you need to keep the parts around. Only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem in this case is that when you update sprot, the uniprot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> merged databank is no longer accessible until it is recreated itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know yet if this will be a problem in real life.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could be. The fact that during an appreciable period of time the
</I>&gt;<i> UniProt databank is not accessible, even in the middle of the night,
</I>&gt;<i> could be a problem, certainly if some automated script tries to  
</I>&gt;<i> retrieve a
</I>&gt;<i> sequence.
</I>&gt;<i> Is a mechanism where the index files for SwissProt, TrEMBL and  
</I>&gt;<i> UniProt are
</I>&gt;<i> first created under another name and only then all together &quot;moved&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> over
</I>&gt;<i> the old version (kinda like the on-line/off-line mechanism of SRS)
</I>&gt;<i> thinkable ?
</I>
The new setup will use a dedicated daemon process that serves the  
entries using a SOAP protocol. I've designed the server so that it  
keeps the databanks loaded continuously. In that case it doesn't  
matter if you delete a file while it is being used since the file  
will actually be deleted only once the last process has closed it.  
The idea is to send a SIGHUP signal to the daemon once indexing is  
done and the daemon will reload the databanks.

But maybe it is better to simply copy over the data for UniProt,  
after all we're talking about ~5 Gb and that's peanuts. If I do it  
this way, there's no risk of having an unaccessible UniProt during an  
update.

As for EMBL, I think I will create this new update databank that uses  
the release databank and links to it. I will then also implement some  
fall back mechanism to use when the release databank has changed. I  
don't think that will be too hard to do.

mvg,

Maarten L. Hekkelman
