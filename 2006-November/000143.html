<PRE>Hi,

OK, here's another question regarding MRS development.

MRS uses several ways to locate files and directories. The website  
uses a mrs.conf file in the cgi-bin directory, the makefiles use a  
make_xxx.conf file and mrs_blast uses the environmental variable  
MRS_DATA_DIR to name just a few.

That's a bit confusing.

So I'm considering dropping all this and replace it with one new  
system wide configuration file containing all that is needed in  
combination with a mrs-config application that works like pkg-config.  
I think this might be a bit easier to maintain and configure since  
there would be only one place left to set up everything related to MRS.

In detail I'm thinking about:

- Create a new configuration file format using XML. This file  
describes where to place files on your disk, where applications and  
scripts are located, what formatting filters to use for which  
databank, etc.

- This config file would be located in /etc, /usr/local/etc, or any  
other directory determined at installation time. Possibly  
a .mrs_config in the users home directory may override what is in the  
system config file.

- The mrs-config application reads this config file and prints on  
stdout the information requested. This way you can e.g. ask it for  
the location of the mrs data directory or the flags to use to link  
against libmrs.

- All other tools will use this new config file to find what they  
need to know. The makefile system will use the config file using the  
pkg-config application.

I really would like to know if you have any comments on this.

Best regards,

-maarten
