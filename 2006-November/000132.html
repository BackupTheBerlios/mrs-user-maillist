<PRE>Hi,

I'm currently working on a redesign of the MRS internals. This is  
needed for the next big step forward, the goal is to have relevance  
scoring and initial results are very promising. However, I also  
encountered a few problems that forced me to reflect upon the current  
design.

The plain and simple databank works fine. Searching for three very  
common terms (human, kinase and protein) in the huge embl_release  
takes only 1.5 seconds. That's not bad if you consider that this  
means you have to find the intersection of three lists with millions  
of documents and score them along the way. Searching for a less  
common term is much faster, in the order of 0.001 seconds.

However, searching a concatenated databank like UniProt doesn't work  
as well. The problem is that you need a document weight table for the  
vector algorithm and this table takes into account the occurrence of  
words in the index. If you simply concatenate the weight tables of  
two distinct databanks you get different results when compared with a  
single databank containing the same set of documents.

Another problem is that an iterator for a combined databank is a bit  
more complex and thus takes more time to process all entries. A  
vector search on the combined 'sprot+trembl' takes almost twice as  
long compared to a search on a single uniprot databank.

Things get worse when using update databanks. The search that took  
1.5 second on embl_release takes 0.02 seconds on embl_updates but  
takes 7.6 seconds on 'embl_release|embl_updates'. That's clearly not  
acceptable.

So I'm considering to drop the concatenated databanks and replace the  
update databanks with something new.

To replace the concatenated databanks, you can merge the parts.  
Merging sprot and trembl on my server takes about 15 minutes. And it  
is possible to create a merged databank that doesn't copy the  
document data, in that case you need to keep the parts around. Only  
problem in this case is that when you update sprot, the uniprot  
merged databank is no longer accessible until it is recreated itself.  
I don't know yet if this will be a problem in real life.

The update mechanism can be replaced by something similar to a merged  
databank. In that case you create a databank that links to the  
original databank for the old data and stores the update records in  
its own file. This means however that you are no longer able to  
search the updates databank itself. You then only have the original  
databank and the combined updated databank.

So the question is, is it acceptable to no longer be able to search  
the updates databanks separately?

Best regards,

-maarten
