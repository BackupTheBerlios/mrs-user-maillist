<PRE>Hi Alex,

 &gt; I am still running MRS-3 on our Mac OS X Server and would like to move
 &gt; MRS to a new Linux based system.

Good choice. I'm certainly not a Linux fanboy, but it is the best OS to 
run MRS at the moment.

 &gt; Could you give me advise on which is the easiest way to get a fresh
 &gt; running MRS system.
 &gt;
 &gt; Which Linux should I go for? Do you have some detailled instructions?

If you plan on building EMBL or other large databanks you'd best buy 
multicore hardware with sufficient memory. We have 32 GB of main memory 
which is good enough. The disks we're using are MD1120's from Dell, a 
very fast and reliable 2.5&quot; RAID cabinet that can be expanded (we just 
added a second enclosure).

As for the OS, best is to use the same as I use: Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit. 
(Lucid)

To install you could follow the instructions here:

<A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs-web/help.do?page=50">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs-web/help.do?page=50</A>

But I think it may be better to use the HEAD revision from the SVN 
repository right now. To do so, you should check out the source code 
using subversion. First install subversion (apt-get install subversion) 
and then type:

svn checkout <A HREF="https://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs/trunk">https://svn.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs/trunk</A> mrs

And then continue the process as indicated in the help pages. The help 
page hasn't been updated in some time, but I think they're still useful.

If you run into trouble, let me know and I'll try to help you out. I 
wouldn't be surprised if there are still some small problems left in the 
code. I haven't had time to polish it for a new release.
