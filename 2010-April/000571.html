<PRE>I'm working on a new release for MRS. It will be a minor upgrade to iron 
out some problems that have come up recently.

First of all I will switch over from using Expat and libxml2 to my own 
libzeep XML library. This has the added benefit that I can easily check 
the config files for consistency and detect configuration errors. In the 
process I've changed the file layout and the new one is not compatible 
with the old.

I also added a better check for correct joined databanks. There was a 
problem that if one of the parts of a joined databank was out-of-date, 
the rest would still be loaded and the index would be incorrect leading 
to incorrect results for queries.

But since I fixed this, I found out that it is very important you keep 
an eye on the update process. If the update does not end properly, the 
flags directory is not emptied and as a result the joined databanks do 
not get build. I'll fix this as well, but for now I would like to 
suggest you check this flags directory when something goes wrong and 
empty it by hand if there's anything left in it.
