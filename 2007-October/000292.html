<PRE>Hi Roberto,

&gt;<i> I have a similar problem that George Magklaras has, but with gene.cmp &#191;Any
</I>&gt;<i> idea?. Here is the gene.cmp contents:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -r-------- 1 root root  218 Oct 19 18:55 gene.cmp
</I>&gt;<i> -rw------- 1 root root    0 Oct 19 18:55 gene.cmp.fulltext_indx.XX4dp7TZ
</I>&gt;<i> -rw------- 1 root root    0 Oct 19 18:55 gene.cmp.offsets.XXy4tPCq
</I>
This seems to be a very different problem. The size of the gene.cmp file 
is only as long as the first header structure and the rest of the files 
are empty. This means no data was processed at all.

For gene you need to have the gene2xml application. Did you install 
that? I'm sorry, this is not documented anywhere yet. You can find the 
application somewhere at the NCBI site.

&gt;<i> Also the embl_release finish without problem (I think?); Here is the mrs folder
</I>&gt;<i> contents:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -r-------- 1 root root  20G Oct 28 16:43 embl_release-7.cmp
</I> &gt; ...
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but the embl_release.cmp does not appear, the embl_release.make_log reports
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;invalid mrs data file&quot; at the mrs.pl merge step
</I>
Do you have more detailed output from this log file? You could also 
check each part separately by running 'mrs.pl info -d 
embl_release-x.cmp' on each to see if there's any output at all or an 
error message. If one is corrupt you might want to delete that part and 
restart the make.

There are a few problems with the current MRS when indexing a large 
databank as EMBL. The trunk of the SVN tree at Berlios fixes all but one 
of them. I haven't had the time to fix this last problem yet, I hope to 
have the time this week.

To build the latest EMBL release you have to check out the source code 
from Berlios, build a new MRS and make sure you copy the stop.txt file 
from the mrs/plugin directory to the /usr/local/share/mrs/update_scripts 
directory. This file contains stop words to use and limits the size of 
the indices which is essential to avoid the last bug.

I really hope I will have a fixed MRS by the end of this week. I'll keep 
you all posted.
