<PRE>I am a bit confused with the mrs SOAP services. My current understanding is
this:

There are actually two SOAP servers. One is represented by the daemon mrs-ws
and its ports are defined in mrs-config.xml. The second is mrsweb
application running usually in Tomcat or Glassfish. Its interface is defined
by the provided WSDL(s) and it accomplishes all incoming tasks (queries) by
passing them to the mrs-ws server. The mrsweb finds an mrs-web server as
defined in the environment entries
mrsws-[search|admin|blast|clustal]-location.

Is the assumption above correct please?

If so, I wonder:

* Is it possible to make my queries directly to the mrs-ws server, even if
it does not run on the same machine (assuming that there is no blocking
firewall in between). If so, does it use its own WSDL, or the WSDL is the
same as for mrsweb? And what is actually an address (location) of such
service? Or, is this server meant to be only &quot;internal&quot; and I should always
use only the route via mrsweb?

* When I run my own mrsweb, where can I configure its own address
(location)? - I need this in order to change it in my WSDL [The searches
made from my mrsweb makes searches correctly using my own, local, databases,
but the mrsweb home page unfortunately still displays links to the WSDLs at
mrs.cmbi.ru.nl.]

Many thanks,
Martin
