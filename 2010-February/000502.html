<PRE>Many thanks for your clarification. It's very helpful, and I think I am
almost there :-)

Just to re-iterate (to be sure that I got it right):

* All SOAP requests are directed to the mrs-ws server (or servers). Either
directly, using just the needed port, e.g. <A HREF="http://localhost:18081/,">http://localhost:18081/,</A> or (more
often) using a reverse proxy that maps various URLs - all usually coming via
port 80 - to the individual ports/machines of the mrs-ws(s).

* The mrsweb application uses the mrs-ws - meaning that mrsweb is a SOAP
client (and it does the SOAP calls via classes generated from the WSDL).

Few things, however, are still a bit vague to me:

* Who (what) generates WSDL - the one with my own service location (taken
from the &lt;external-address&gt; in mrs-config.xml)? Or perhaps nobody generates
it, perhaps I need to change it there manually? Then, who is using the tag
&lt;external-address&gt;? Does the mrs-ws server need to know its own external
address (probably not)?

* Why the released mrs war file has the WSDL files in the WEB-INF directory?
I would think that the WSDL files should be in the publicly available space,
not in the hidden WEB-INF. Or, perhaps they are generated on the fly when
requested for (something like that was possible with axis1)?

* Finally, is there a SOAP operation returning the list of available
databanks? [Or is the select menu in the top of the main web page, the &quot;All
Databanks&quot;, hard-coded?]. Could it be the UpdateStatusInfo, perhaps?

Thanks and I am sorry for bothering with so many questions (I promise I will
stop soon),
Martin
