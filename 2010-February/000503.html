cool!

&gt;<i> Just to re-iterate (to be sure that I got it right):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * All SOAP requests are directed to the mrs-ws server (or servers). 
</I>&gt;<i> Either directly, using just the needed port, e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://localhost:18081/,">http://localhost:18081/,</A> or (more often) using a reverse proxy that 
</I>&gt;<i> maps various URLs - all usually coming via port 80 - to the individual 
</I>&gt;<i> ports/machines of the mrs-ws(s).
</I>
Yup, e.g. the address <A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsws/search">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsws/search</A> is a reverse 
proxy for <A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl:8087/">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl:8087/</A>

&gt;<i> * The mrsweb application uses the mrs-ws - meaning that mrsweb is a 
</I>&gt;<i> SOAP client (and it does the SOAP calls via classes generated from the 
</I>&gt;<i> WSDL).
</I>
exactly.

&gt;<i> Few things, however, are still a bit vague to me:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Who (what) generates WSDL - the one with my own service location 
</I>&gt;<i> (taken from the &lt;external-address&gt; in mrs-config.xml)? Or perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> nobody generates it, perhaps I need to change it there manually? Then, 
</I>&gt;<i> who is using the tag &lt;external-address&gt;? Does the mrs-ws server need 
</I>&gt;<i> to know its own external address (probably not)?
</I>
The WSDL is generated on-the-fly by mrs-ws. I've used libzeep (one of my 
other projects) to create mrs-ws and it automatically generates all SOAP 
code based on the signture of exported C++ functions. Therefore, the 
mrs-ws application needs to know the external address since it is part 
of the WSDL and the reverse proxy does not translate this. (It does this 
kind of magic on HTML e.g.).

&gt;<i> * Why the released mrs war file has the WSDL files in the WEB-INF 
</I>&gt;<i> directory? I would think that the WSDL files should be in the publicly 
</I>&gt;<i> available space, not in the hidden WEB-INF. Or, perhaps they are 
</I>&gt;<i> generated on the fly when requested for (something like that was 
</I>&gt;<i> possible with axis1)?
</I>
Because CXF is not very smart, in my humble opinion. When setting up the 
classes in the web application it needs to parse a WSDL and this file 
needs to be present somewhere. Anyway, the web app is tightly bound to 
the SOAP server and they need to be kept in sync.

&gt;<i> * Finally, is there a SOAP operation returning the list of available 
</I>&gt;<i> databanks? [Or is the select menu in the top of the main web page, the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;All Databanks&quot;, hard-coded?]. Could it be the UpdateStatusInfo, perhaps?
</I>

&gt;<i> Thanks and I am sorry for bothering with so many questions (I promise 
</I>&gt;<i> I will stop soon),
</I>
These questions don't bother me, I'm very happy someone took the time to 
ask them.
