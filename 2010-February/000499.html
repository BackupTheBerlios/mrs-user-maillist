<PRE>Hi Martin,

The SOAP/Web server set-up may indeed be a bit complicated. The goal was
to make it flexible so that you can have multiple SOAP servers that can
be located behind reverse proxies.

As you noticed, there is a soap:address location attribute in a WSDL
file and the server generating this WSDL has to know what value to put
here. By default is uses its own hostname and port to put here, but if
you're using a reverse proxy you'll have to provide the outside address
using the mrs-config.xml file. You should use &lt;external-address&gt;
tag--which can be a child of the &lt;server&gt; tag--for this.

This way you can decouple the physical location of your mrs SOAP server
from the outside address. It also means you can have separate computers
for doing BLAST and regular searches. And it is now also quite trivial
to write a layer in between to create a so-called 'federated' MRS: a
broker could have knowledge of multiple MRS servers around the globe and
could redirect search requests to the server nearest by, or the one
having the most up-to-date version of some databank, or perhaps the
fastest one.

The MRS web application (the Java war) is not a SOAP server even though
I may have erroneously put in AXIS 2 code. It uses (or should use) CXF
to access the SOAP server mrs-ws.

And then the urls in the welcome page, I'm afraid they're hard-coded :-/
You'll have to edit the welcome.jsp page in order to fix this. I'll see
if I can fix this in a future release.

&gt;<i> I am a bit confused with the mrs SOAP services. My current
</I>&gt;<i> understanding is this:		
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are actually two SOAP servers. One is represented by the daemon
</I>&gt;<i> mrs-ws and its ports are defined in mrs-config.xml. The second is
</I>&gt;<i> mrsweb application running usually in Tomcat or Glassfish. Its
</I>&gt;<i> interface is defined by the provided WSDL(s) and it accomplishes all
</I>&gt;<i> incoming tasks (queries) by passing them to the mrs-ws server. The
</I>&gt;<i> mrsweb finds an mrs-web server as defined in the environment entries
</I>&gt;<i> mrsws-[search|admin|blast|clustal]-location.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is the assumption above correct please?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If so, I wonder:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Is it possible to make my queries directly to the mrs-ws server,
</I>&gt;<i> even if it does not run on the same machine (assuming that there is no
</I>&gt;<i> blocking firewall in between). If so, does it use its own WSDL, or the
</I>&gt;<i> WSDL is the same as for mrsweb? And what is actually an address
</I>&gt;<i> (location) of such service? Or, is this server meant to be only
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;internal&quot; and I should always use only the route via mrsweb?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * When I run my own mrsweb, where can I configure its own address
</I>&gt;<i> (location)? - I need this in order to change it in my WSDL [The
</I>&gt;<i> searches made from my mrsweb makes searches correctly using my own,
</I>&gt;<i> local, databases, but the mrsweb home page unfortunately still
</I>&gt;<i> displays links to the WSDLs at mrs.cmbi.ru.nl.] 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Martin
