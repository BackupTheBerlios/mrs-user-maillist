<PRE>Hi,

I am installing MRS in KAUST (a new university in Saudi Arabia) - and
everything seems to work fine (except the compilation problem under Karmic -
but it was very promptly addressed by Maarten; thanks again). The small
problem, I would call it rather an inconvenience, is that due to network
problems I have to fetch data on my machine and parse them on another. I
wonder if the update_scripts/Makefile could have separate targets for
'fetch' and for 'mrs'. I have changed it myself in my Makefile - but it is a
long time since I had been working with Makefile so I would rather see done
it by an expert. It also has to address the issue with data post-processing
(at the moment, this is an issue only for 'gene' databank) - which lies
between 'fetching' and 'parsing'. But I guess this would not be a real
problem, either.

I wonder if somebody is planning (or has done)  such changes in the
Makefile?

Thanks,
Martin
