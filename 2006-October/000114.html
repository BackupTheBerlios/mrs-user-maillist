I think you should put this in your list of things-to-do. Most of the 
time case-insensitive searches are the best, but there are few cases 
where we might need a case-sensitive index for the primary key (ID) 
(like for the PDB sequences) or for some other indexes (I cannot just 
right now find an example). There must then be a way, in the parser 
script or elsewhere, to explicitly state that a certain index must be 
case-sensitive.

Certainly a good idea to avoid MRS crashing on spurious duplicate ID's.

As far as GenBank is concerned : duplicate ID's are a chronic disease, 
they seem not to stick to their own rule of having the ID's unique. A 
solution is to use the accession number as primary key. Is it allowed in 
MRS to call the primary key index by another name than 'id' ? 

&gt;<i> Rewriting different case in ID's to something like LC_id can be done

</I>&gt;<i> this. Though I get the feeling that you trying to find a workaround

</I>
I surely agree with that.
