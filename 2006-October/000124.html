</I>&gt;<i> At the Belgian EMBnet Node we have started to use MRS as sequence  
</I>&gt;<i> access
</I>&gt;<i> method and with this a problem has become visible : the time-out of  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> Web Services. It is convenient to use the MRS Web Services to  
</I>&gt;<i> retrieve one
</I>&gt;<i> or a few sequences and give them as input to a program. It does  
</I>&gt;<i> however
</I>&gt;<i> not work if the sequences are with too many. E.g. a query  
</I>&gt;<i> id:*_mouse in
</I>&gt;<i> UniProt is convenient to obtain all the mouse sequences, but in our  
</I>&gt;<i> hands
</I>&gt;<i> it often times out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A question for the developper : do you think the problem is inside  
</I>&gt;<i> MRS (and
</I>&gt;<i> could be fixed) or is it due to the configuration of our httpd  
</I>&gt;<i> server ?
</I>
I'm not sure about this, but what I do know is that MRS can be  
improved. I am going to write a new web services implementation  
that's not Perl but C++ based and this should be much faster.

I have one question though, do you use MRS to retrieve sequences (and  
thus e.g. extract a record and parse it for the sequence) or do you  
mean you want to use for fetching entire records only?

The reason I'm asking this is, I believe that often you're interested  
in only three or four parts of information from a record. The entire  
record (duh..), the sequence, the description or title and the the  
record ID which indicates that the record actually exists. For two of  
these four cases you need to parse the record and that's time  
consuming. Especially when this parsing is done at the client side so  
that all records have to be passed over the wire.

What I would like to do is add the title (or description) of a record  
to the databank. If you then use a GetEntry call to fetch some data  
you can specify if you want the entire record, a description or the  
sequence of the record. When properly implemented this can be done by  
adding only a couple of bytes per record in the databank.

Another possibility might be to convert each record to XML before  
storing it. If done properly, you could regenerate the original  
record from this XML using a XML stylesheet. The interesting new  
opportunities you get this way are the ability to use xpaths to  
search and retrieve data. But I'm afraid this is going to be a bit  
too much change for now.

I would appreciate hearing any idea on this topic.

mvg,

Maarten L. Hekkelman
