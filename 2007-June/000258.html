<PRE>Dear Alvaro,

I'm sorry about your installation woes. It seems my install script  
isn't finished yet, I'll try to fix those problems asap.

What you should do on MacOS is use DarwinPorts, or MacPorts as it is  
called these days. Using that you can type

	port install boost
	port install gsoap

and that's about all you need to have both boost and gsoap installed  
on your computer. See &lt;<A HREF="http://www.macports.org/">http://www.macports.org/</A>&gt;

To use the soap servers, you will have to start them manually. I did  
not include scripts to start mrsws and friends automatically, I  
always start them from within a 'screen' session on my computers.  
That way I can monitor what happens. I'll see if I can write some  
script to startup these SOAP servers at boot time, but that's all  
very system specific.

Now I will try to answer your questions.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 ) Down there are the starting lines of my etc/mrs-config.xml for my
</I>&gt;<i> three SOAP servers. It seems that both search and blast have no -exe
</I>&gt;<i> entity as for &lt;clustalw-exe&gt;. Is that okay? How is it then the blast
</I>&gt;<i> run? I guess it is some kind of client itself to another blast
</I>&gt;<i> service... but a better explanation? Is it WS reading this file so  
</I>&gt;<i> if I
</I>&gt;<i> change the params (specially, ports) will be automatically taken.
</I>
I've implemented the Blast algorithm myself. It is fully compatible  
with NCBI blastall version 2.2.7 (I believe). That's how I can do  
blast searches against the results of a boolean MRS query.

&gt;<i> 2 ) I indexed BLOCKS successfully BLOCKS but I can see it anywhere in
</I>&gt;<i> the databanks. And there are some small databases that I want to index
</I>&gt;<i> and fail. How can I trace why.
</I>
First of all, when you build a databank there will be logs files  
written in $MRS_DATA_DIR/status . These log files are rotated so you  
can see older versions as well. They contain the output for all steps  
taken in mirroring and updating the data files.

There is a script for these log files that produces a web page like  
this:

&lt;<A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs/cgi-bin/databanks.cgi">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs/cgi-bin/databanks.cgi</A>&gt;

This script is part of the MRS 2 package, I've not yet created such a  
page for MRS-3 but you can install the MRS-2 cgi scripts if you want.  
They can be fetched from Berlios with svn from the location:

<A HREF="https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/mrs/branches/2.0/web-simple/">https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/mrs/branches/2.0/web-simple/</A>

Then, when the mrs file is created, you must make sure the file is  
also readable by the mrsws application. (permissions) And if you  
update a file by hand you have to tell the running mrsws application  
that the data has been updated by issuing:

killall -HUP mrsws

That will tell the running mrsws to reload all datafiles.

&gt;<i> 3 ) This last question is useful because I have had no time to look  
</I>&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;<i> the make process of MRS. Is anybody with a good pointer to  
</I>&gt;<i> documentation
</I>&gt;<i> where to read about &quot;How to add my own/additional databanks to my  
</I>&gt;<i> site&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;how to write parsers for them?&quot;.
</I>
Look at <A HREF="https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/mrs/branches/3.0.1/doc/">https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/mrs/branches/3.0.1/doc/</A>

There's a file called mrs-plugin-tutorial.txt

It contains most of the information you need to create your own parsers.

&gt;<i> I have my own databases downloaded (Swissprot, EnsEMBL) and I would  
</I>&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;<i> to try to index them. I haven't got very far until now in  
</I>&gt;<i> understanding
</I>&gt;<i> the make.pre and make.post mechanism but I hope for some help.
</I>
The tutorial tells you about the plugin architecture. The make files  
are not fully documented yet I believe. You could try to write them  
by homology for now and ask for help here. I'll try to write better  
documentation soon.

&gt;<i> 4 ) How to use successfully and develop a web client service for MRS?
</I>&gt;<i> How can I use the 3 SOAP servers available?
</I>
The wsdl files are generated in the mrs/ws/*/Sources directories.

The URL &lt;<A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs/doc/">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrs/doc/</A>&gt; points to some documentation  
about the C++ interface of the MRS library. This documentation can be  
generated locally by issuing the command

make doc

in the plugin directory. You do need the tool doxygen for that  
though. The Perl plugin is directly constructed from this C++  
interface and thus has the same methods and parameters.

To conclude, yes I know that documentation is an issue. I will devote  
most of my time in the coming months on writing better documentation.  
But until then feel free to ask questions here. I'll try to respond  
to them the best I can.

mvg,

Maarten L. Hekkelman
