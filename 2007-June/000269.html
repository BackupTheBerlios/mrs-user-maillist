<PRE>Dear Guy,

&gt;<i> The problem is the following : the EMBL databank is quite big, and  
</I>&gt;<i> the WGS is
</I>&gt;<i> taking a considerable part of it. Now our system manager David is  
</I>&gt;<i> wondering if
</I>&gt;<i> it would not be convenient to download and index the WGS section  
</I>&gt;<i> separately. But
</I>&gt;<i> what if we want still to present EMBL as one databank to our users ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can we merge in two stages ? merge nonwgsrelease + nonwgsupdates  
</I>&gt;<i> into nonwgs,
</I>&gt;<i> merge wgsrelease + wgsupdates into wgs and then merge nonwgs + wgs  
</I>&gt;<i> (which are
</I>&gt;<i> now both indexes without actual data) into embl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or merge all 4 (nonwgsrelease + nonwgsupdates + wgsrelease +  
</I>&gt;<i> wgsupdates) at once
</I>&gt;<i> into embl. But  what if the nonwgs and the wgs are updated on the  
</I>&gt;<i> same day ?
</I>&gt;<i> Would the merging than be performed twice during one run of  
</I>&gt;<i> mrsupdate ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And if we have two separate indexes ? Is it not so that in MRS 3  
</I>&gt;<i> there is,
</I>&gt;<i> contrary to MRS 2, no easy way to search in several databanks at  
</I>&gt;<i> the same time ?
</I>
Merging in stages is definitively supported. In fact, some users use  
this to merge over 600 MRS files into one.

You can use the -l option for 'mrs.pl create' in this case to avoid  
copying over all the data. This option then only creates the index  
and links to the data in the original files.

The option to search multiple databanks as if they are one (dba+dbb 
+dbc) is no longer supported since it was quite a performance  
penalty. And it is not possible to do correct ranked searches in such  
a concatenated set of databanks. On the other hand, search speed for  
individual databanks was considerably improved between 2 and 3 and  
merging doesn't take that long anymore either.

I do see the same problem as you mention here though and I might  
reintroduce the joined databank feature again. However, it is not a  
trivial thing to do and I will have to spend quite a bit of time to  
do it right.

mvg,

Maarten L. Hekkelman
