<PRE>Hello mrs-users,

I have installed mrs-3.0-rc2 on Mac OS X 10.4 but I am experiencing some
problems I want to solve. I am going to tell my experience in every step
in case anyone goes for the same platform (as I did not found any report
in the mailing lists). My questions are in a block down there so if you
want to go for them, just search for ## QUESTIONS ## in my email.

I know that the developer Maarten Hekkelman develops himself in this
platform so I hope he has gone through some of this and can help me to
explain better the architecture/problems I am experiencing.

First, if I want to follow that MRS mantra:

perl install.pl
make
make install
cd /usr/local/share/mrs/update_scripts
make enzyme

The first step &quot;perl install.pl&quot;. This looks for all the prerequisites
in your platform: a c++ compiler (Mac OS X has gcc 4.01 right now), TR1
headers that comes with most of the distributions of the GNU compiler
and the first hurdle: Swig. Swig was not installed so I installed
swig-1.3.31 and it installed smoothly. After that, it was soapcpp2 so I
took a binary for Mac OS X but compile from sources it is straight away
and you will get the library libgsoap++ that you will need later when
linking MRS web services. Then the big headache: boost. I took
boost_1_34_0 and never got it configured but I realised that the fink
project had a port of libboost and his tool bjam so I chose these ones
to install and compiled MRS modifying a few directory paths in the
install.pl program (basically libraries and headers directories where to
search for boost libs and incs).

After making, when I get to

:<i>~/src/mrs-3.0-rc2 alvaro$ make install
</I>make: `install' is up to date.

So I suspected something was missing and there it was: I got an empty
bin folder under my chosen path (/usr/local/mrs/bin) and no mrs-3.war
anywhere.

So as the INSTALL document says: &quot;The next step is to either use the MRS
perl plugin directly from your scripts&quot;. So I did not have any scripts
and I had not realise I had no plugins...

First time I tried:

:<i>/usr/local/mrs/update_scripts alvaro$ sudo make enzyme
</I>make /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.done
make: success
sync
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/status/enzyme.fetched
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.fetched
make: failed
sync
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/status/enzyme.make
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.make
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/status/enzyme.done
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.done
No matching processes were found
mrsws does not seem to run
rm /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.*

As it was looking effectively for mrsws, I looked also for it and then,
I discover it in my source directory (src/mrs-3.0-rc2). Why &quot;make
install&quot; did not put it in my bin? So I just took mrsws, mrsws-blast and
mrsws-clustal and copied them to /usr/local/mrs/bin. I started them (not
still in the background to see what they were doing!).

But then I retried:

:<i>/usr/local/mrs/update_scripts alvaro$ sudo make enzyme
</I>make /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.done
make: success
sync
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/status/enzyme.fetched
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.fetched
make: failed
sync
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/status/enzyme.make
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.make
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/status/enzyme.done
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.done
rm /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.*

And failed badly (guess because I didn't relise by then of the plugin
stuff).

So I could not check if everything was in place as I had 1-) No
databanks. 2-) No interface to look at.

In the INSTALL doc, when it comes to the &quot;Web interface&quot; paragraph, it
says you should have a mrs-3.war file but in my case it was not in my
install tree (of course) but on my source directory (src/mrs-3.0-rc2)
and then I just copied it under Tomcat webbapps directory (a .war file
is an already deployed application) but I think this should be comment
somewhere.

When I reloaded &quot;<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/mrs-3/">http://localhost:8080/mrs-3/</A>&quot;, it just said what I was
afraid of:

&quot;Could not connect to SOAP server at <A HREF="http://localhost:8081/mrs/soap,">http://localhost:8081/mrs/soap,</A>
please inform administrator.&quot;

In very red letters so something was wrong but I couldn't guess why. I
guess now that it was the API needed for the web services what was not
into place but I discovered that this morning.

I was reading an MRS report about MRS at the EMBnet.news magazine by
Robert Herzog (of the Belgian EMBnet node) where it was referred a
installation manual that I downloaded from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.be.embnet.org/pub/biosoft/MRS/MRS-2.0%20v0.6%20Howto.doc">ftp://ftp.be.embnet.org/pub/biosoft/MRS/MRS-2.0%20v0.6%20Howto.doc</A>

And in that doc, finally I saw a thing I did have not done... Before
doing any make in the root src directory, you would:

cd plugin
make
sudo make install

And here we go, that gave me a bundle, a pm module and some more
commands in my /usr/local/mrs/bin directory...

And then it also worked the installation of the enzyme dataset:

</I>make /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.done
make: success
sync
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/status/enzyme.fetched

touch /usr/local/mrs/data/status/enzyme.done
touch /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.done
rm /usr/local/mrs/data/flags/enzyme.*

And my web interface after refreshing :)

## QUESTIONS ##

1 ) Down there are the starting lines of my etc/mrs-config.xml for my
three SOAP servers. It seems that both search and blast have no -exe
entity as for &lt;clustalw-exe&gt;. Is that okay? How is it then the blast
run? I guess it is some kind of client itself to another blast
service... but a better explanation? Is it WS reading this file so if I
change the params (specially, ports) will be automatically taken.

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;mrs-config&gt;
        &lt;!-- generic, paths and stuff --&gt;
        &lt;datadir&gt;/usr/local/mrs/data//mrs&lt;/datadir&gt;
        &lt;scriptdir&gt;/usr/local/mrs/parser_scripts/&lt;/scriptdir&gt;

        &lt;!-- service specific settings --&gt;
        &lt;search-ws&gt;
                &lt;address&gt;localhost&lt;/address&gt;
                &lt;port&gt;8081&lt;/port&gt;
                &lt;logfile&gt;/var/log/mrsws-search.log&lt;/logfile&gt;
        &lt;/search-ws&gt;

        &lt;blast-ws&gt;
                &lt;address&gt;localhost&lt;/address&gt;
                &lt;port&gt;8082&lt;/port&gt;
                &lt;logfile&gt;/var/log/mrsws-blast.log&lt;/logfile&gt;
        &lt;/blast-ws&gt;

        &lt;clustal-ws&gt;
                &lt;address&gt;localhost&lt;/address&gt;
                &lt;port&gt;8083&lt;/port&gt;
                &lt;logfile&gt;/var/log/mrsws-clustal.log&lt;/logfile&gt;
                &lt;clustalw-exe&gt;/usr/ebiotools/bin/clustalw&lt;/clustalw-exe&gt;
                &lt;max-run-time&gt;15&lt;/max-run-time&gt;
        &lt;/clustal-ws&gt;

        &lt;!-- list of databases to present --&gt;
        &lt;dbs&gt;

2 ) I indexed BLOCKS successfully BLOCKS but I can see it anywhere in
the databanks. And there are some small databases that I want to index
and fail. How can I trace why.

3 ) This last question is useful because I have had no time to look into
the make process of MRS. Is anybody with a good pointer to documentation
where to read about &quot;How to add my own/additional databanks to my site&quot;
and &quot;how to write parsers for them?&quot;.

I have my own databases downloaded (Swissprot, EnsEMBL) and I would like
to try to index them. I haven't got very far until now in understanding
the make.pre and make.post mechanism but I hope for some help.

4 ) How to use successfully and develop a web client service for MRS?
How can I use the 3 SOAP servers available?

All this documentation is missed in the document coming from the link I
gave above and I would find it very useful. I have seen some courses
given by the Belgian EMBnet node (see
<A HREF="http://www.be.embnet.org/tutorials/Introduction%20to%20MRS">http://www.be.embnet.org/tutorials/Introduction%20to%20MRS</A>). Does any of
you have documentation or experience about this guys?

Thanks a lot if you can help me with this issues,
&#225;lvaro
