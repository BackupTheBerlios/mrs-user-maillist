Oh dear, was I too blunt again? Well, my excuse is being Dutch and as 
such I'm severely handicapped of course.

&gt;<i> Except, perhaps, the fact (or rather my assumption) that the &quot;REST 
</I>&gt;<i> style call&quot; that you suggested to use is also not documented anywhere. 
</I>&gt;<i> Or is it? I would like to know because it may be really useful.
</I>
Well, in a way it is documented. The REST style interface is based on 
the SOAP interface as it is generated on the fly from the same code. I 
may even create a WSDL 2.0 for it, once I have the time to find out how 
I'm supposed to do that.

But it really is very simple, take a look at the WSDL and there you find 
the names of all functions and their parameters. For all the 'simple' 
calls (calls that only take basic input parameters, no structures) you 
can construct the REST URL as was given the example:

First the machine address and the (reverse proxied port):

<A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsws">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsws</A>

(might also be e.g. <A HREF="http://localhost:18081/">http://localhost:18081/</A>)

Then the path to the rest call:

rest/GetEntry

And then the parameters as name/value pairs:

db/sprot and id/104k_thepa

Together:

<A HREF="http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsws/rest/GetEntry/db/sprot/id/104k_thepa">http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/mrsws/rest/GetEntry/db/sprot/id/104k_thepa</A>
