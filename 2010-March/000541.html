<PRE>Hi Georgios,

&gt;<i> I will post the slides of the presentation for the list if anyone is 
</I>&gt;<i> interested.
</I>
Cool, I would really like to see those.

&gt;<i> MRS made a very good impression to the students here, especially the 
</I>&gt;<i> command line functionality (thanks to Martin for the MRS::Client. We 
</I>&gt;<i> have tried a few things and I have some feedback).
</I>
Yes, Martin's Perl plug-in is awesome. Some of my colleagues are now 
using it and it was really very nice to point them to cpan.org for code 
and documentation.

&gt;<i> As for the memory. Hmm, I see that during 25 active sessions, the 
</I>&gt;<i> mrs-ws process reaches various tenths of gigabytes. When the JVM 
</I>&gt;<i> Tomcat java process had a base of 16 Gbytes, the SOAP server was 
</I>&gt;<i> reaching (during the blast and search queries) a dead end. So, I 
</I>&gt;<i> assumed that this is something with the SOAP dumping back results to 
</I>&gt;<i> Tomcat and reaching a dead end.
</I>
Did mrs-ws end up being unresponsive? And do you perhaps know which part 
of mrs-ws was using all the memory? If you do a 'ps xgauf' you'll see 
the process hierarchy as well as lots of info on the memory and cpu 
usage of each process. It is often quite easy to find out which forked 
mrs-ws is doing what.

I don't believe we had problems with MRS during courses recently. I 
think we also have more than 20 students per course. If MRS fails, I'm 
the first to know but it's a long time since I had the last emergency 
phone call from a classroom. Now if mrs-ws runs out of memory, it simply 
crashes and is automatically relaunched. That may have happened and 
often no one notices this.

The software that gave the most problems up until now was Tomcat and 
since we replaced it with glassfish I must say things seem to be much 
more stable.

It might be that mrs-ws leaks memory, but I believe what you saw was 
caching of blast results as well as memory mapping of parts of the index 
of mrs files.
