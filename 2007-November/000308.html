<PRE>Hello,
You might like to know that I succeeded in building and running a 
functional MRS server on a fresh Ubuntu linux box, from the trunk of the 
MRS distribution as found on the Berlios SVN server yesterday.

A few things required attention:
- the detection of required libraries missed libperl, libexpat, libattr1 
and the three or four libboost-something (-regex, etc) that are 
required. Their identification is simple while tryinfg to compile
- the make.config at the root of the MRS installation required the 
addition of a &quot;/&quot; at the end of each of the &quot;path&quot; definitions - lack of 
this produced directories named &quot;dataflags&quot;, &quot;dataraw&quot;, datamrs, est, 
rather than the required &quot;data/raw&quot;, &quot;data/flags&quot;, etc.
- the copy of the parsers and update scripts to the recommended (at 
least preconfigured) /usr/local/data path had to be done by hand, as 
they are originally available under the root of the mrs tree

Installation of tomcat was from the Ubuntu ditribution (tomcat 5.5). I 
had to declare the proper users in the /etc/tomcat5.5/tomcat-users.xml 
file (manager and admin) and deactivate security in the 
/etc/default/tomcat5.5 (TOMCAT5_SECURITY=NO) as recommended by Maarten

I could start the web services (mrsws, mrs-blast and mrs-clustal) from 
their respective directories in the ws subtree, and then the mount the 
mrs-war file.

Building the enzyme databank succeeded and it became available under the 
web interface. I then built prosite, go and a few other small datasets, 
and they were nicely searchable. I then imported the uniprot datafiles.
Building sprot took about one hour but trembl takes longer, as the 
machine is swapping... it has only 500 Mbyte RAM...!

Thanks to Maarten for the nice piece of software...
Robert Herzog
