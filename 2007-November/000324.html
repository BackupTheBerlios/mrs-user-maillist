good to hear

&gt;<i> One thing that I noticed however is that it is not creating the www
</I>&gt;<i> subdirectory and its contents under /usr/local/share/mrs.  I copied the
</I>&gt;<i> previous one that I had working into this location and it seems to
</I>&gt;<i> work.  Do I need to make this from one of the other subdirectories in
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/local/mrs?
</I>
The www directory is gone since the Perl scripts are no longer
officially supported. They may work for you, but I give no guarantee.

Since I did not implement a good solution for monitoring the update
process I still use the databanks.cgi script myself.

&gt;<i> I am still not quite clear what I need to do to get the web services to
</I>&gt;<i> work though
</I>
You need to install the mrs.war web application in a Tomcat or other
servlet container. If this tomcat is running on another computer you
have to configure it to use your mrsws server. You can do this by
editing the MRS environment with the Tomcat Admin tool that comes with
tomcat.

&gt;<i> For Ubuntu I presume I put the bash files mrsws, mrsws-blast and
</I>&gt;<i> mrsws-clustal into /etc/init.d and that their code must then refer to
</I>&gt;<i> the equivalent binaries.  e.g. mrsws=/usr/scratch/mrs/ws/regular/mrsws
</I>&gt;<i> However for mrsws what does mrs-search refer to (i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/sysconfig/mrsws-search) and also the source function library 
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions.
</I>
The init.d scripts were written for RedHat, I don't know if they work on
other Linux variants, presumably not.

The mrsws application should perhaps be renamed to mrsws-search or
mrsws-regular.

&gt;<i> As far as the wsdl files are concerned I presume I need to modify the
</I>&gt;<i> apachew httpd.conf file to enable the browser to be able to view the
</I>&gt;<i> directory that it finds itself in etc.
</I>
Yes. I configured our web server to act as a reverse proxy for the many
web services we host. It also takes care of serving those wsdl files as
well as passing through the requests for SOAP access.
