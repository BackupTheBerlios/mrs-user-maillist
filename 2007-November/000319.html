Sorry, I should have explained. If perl fails to load the MRS plugin it
would have complained. If it just hangs, it is waiting for standard
input, a script e.g., and so it seems to work properly.

&gt;<i> I then did the replication (is this the right word for this from the
</I>&gt;<i> trunk (first using the update method (svn switch) and then doing a
</I>&gt;<i> replication from scratch using (svn co).  The files were copied to
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/local/mrs_trunk for want of a better place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I then ran ./configure.pl, make and make install from the trunk
</I>&gt;<i> directory.  One of the issues has already been picked up by Herzog
</I>&gt;<i> namely that the / is missing between data and its subdirectories
</I>&gt;<i> resulting in new directories at the data level.
</I>
That should have been fixed in the current code in trunk.

&gt;<i> The other problem that
</I>&gt;<i> I have is that the update_script and parser_script directories have
</I>&gt;<i> somehow been created in each other i.e. they are now
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/local/share/mrs/update_script/update_script and
</I>&gt;<i> .../parser_script/parser_script respectively and even if I copy the
</I>&gt;<i> files into the correct directory there still is a problem.
</I>
remove the /usr/local/data and /usr/local/share/mrs directories
recursively and then rerun 'make' and 'make install'. This should fix
this particular problem.

&gt;<i> In the status log file there seems to be a clue:
</I>&gt;<i> ... at /usr/local/share/mrs/parser_scripts//enzyme.pm line 100 - there
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be a double forward slash.
</I>&gt;<i> and most probably the error:
</I>&gt;<i> Can't locate auto/MRS/MDatabank/StoreMetaDa.al in @INC ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How can I best fix this problem?
</I>
Do you happen to have multiple versions of perl installed on your
computer? Shouldn't be a problem since the configure.pl script should
take care of that, but nevertheless.

And maybe you have an old MRS version located in some other Perl install
directory. If you have locate you might want to look for all occurrences
of MRS.pm and MRS.so on your computer and remove them before
reinstalling. If you don't have locate you might want to use find, like so:

find /usr/lib (or wherever your perl modules are) -name MRS.pm

If this doesn't help, please let me know.
